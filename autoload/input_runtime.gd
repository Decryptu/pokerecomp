class_name Gen2InputRuntime
extends Node

## The live control scheme, and which device the player is actually using.
##
## Two things need one owner. Bindings, because the [InputMap] is engine state
## with no memory of where it came from, so something has to hold the scheme the
## options file describes and put it back after every rebind. And the active
## device, because "is a controller plugged in" is not the question any screen
## asks: what decides whether an on-screen d-pad is drawn is whether the player
## is touching the screen right now.
##
## Screens read this; only the settings page writes to it. They reach it through
## [method instance] rather than through the `InputRuntime` global, for the same
## reason [Gen2WorldScreen] reaches GameRuntime by path: a script handed to
## Godot's `-s` is compiled before the tree that owns the autoloads exists, so a
## preview tool that names a screen by type would fail to load it.

signal device_changed(kind: StringName)
## The effective answer, after both the setting and the active device. Also
## emitted when the frontmost controller changes, since that changes which pad
## should be drawing even though the setting has not moved.
signal touch_controls_changed(shown: bool)
## A rebind landed. What is bound has already been installed in the [InputMap]
## by the time this arrives; a screen only needs it to redraw a legend.
