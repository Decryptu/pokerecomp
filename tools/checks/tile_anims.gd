## Every tileset's `wTilesetAnim` command list, on all three cartridges, run for a
## whole cycle. The list and its commands are byte identical between the pins apart
## from the addresses `Gen2Layout`'s `world_animation_functions` names. What a
## reading of them costs is which command ticks `wTileAnimationTimer`:
## `StandingTileFrame8` and `StandingTileFrame` do, and so does
## `ScrollTileRightLeft`, which is the **only** tick the cave, dark cave and ice
## path lists have. A timer that never moves leaves those three maps with a still
## water palette and a tile scrolling one way for ever.

## The whole set `Gen2WorldAnimation.tick` implements, which is every label
## `_AnimateTileset` can `jp hl` to. An operation outside it is an unread
## function pointer rather than a new command.
