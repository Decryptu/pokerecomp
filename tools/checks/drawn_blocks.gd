## The drawn-block fold, from a map record rather than from a loaded world.
## `Gen2WorldAPI.drawn_block_for` is what a caller with no world has, and it has to
## be the same fold `drawn_block_at` performs, so this sweeps every map of every
## cache over its whole padded rectangle. The count of padded blocks that came from
## a neighbour is reported per game, because two implementations that both answer
## the border block everywhere would agree and prove nothing. SCREEN FILL is the
## same fold one step further out: inside `wOverworldMapBlocks` it is
## `drawn_block_at` byte for byte, and the placed map answers the padding's block.

## `FillMapConnections` writes three blocks of padding on each side.
