## Sweeps every ice cell on every map of all three cartridges through the slide
## `DoPlayerMovement.CheckForced` and `CheckStandingOnIce` produce, rather than
## sampling the Ice Path. A step onto ice leaves `wPlayerTurningDirection` set and
## the next poll rebuilds `wCurInput` as `(input and PAD_BUTTONS) or forced`.

## Three invariants are what a broken slide trips: it has to terminate, which it
## only does because a refusal clears the byte; it has to keep the one direction
## against every held key as well as against none, the d-pad being masked off; and
## each of its steps is `STEP_ICE`, the fast row, rather than a walk.

## A slide can be no longer than the map, so anything past this is a loop.
const RUN_CEILING: int = 512
## Passes to spend draining one step, above any STEP_PASSES_* this can reach.
