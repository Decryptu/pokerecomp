## Verifies Vermilion City, its gym and the passage up from the dock against
## freshly imported real caches, for both command profiles. `VermilionCity.asm` and
## its `.blk` are byte identical between the pins and the gym differs only in
## Surge's text, so nothing here is profile split. The one thing worth pinning is
## that this gym is not its Gen 1 self: there is no trash-can puzzle,
## `VermilionGym_MapScripts` declaring neither a scene nor a callback, so the gym is
## open from the door. The gate is outside it, the whole 42-cell yard walled off by
## a single COLL_CUT_TREE on (13,18), which makes Cut the price of the badge.
