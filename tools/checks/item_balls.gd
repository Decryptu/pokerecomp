## Verifies `OBJECTTYPE_ITEMBALL` and `BGEVENT_ITEM` dispatch against freshly
## imported real caches, for both command profiles.
##
## Expected values come from the pinned pokecrystal and pokegold sources:
## `engine/overworld/events.asm`'s `ObjectEventTypeArray.itemball` and
## `.itemifset`, `engine/events/misc_scripts.asm`'s `FindItemInBallScript`,
## `engine/events/hidden_item.asm`'s `HiddenItemScript`, and the `itemball` and
## `hiddenitem` macros in `macros/scripts/maps.asm`.
##
## The point of pinning both is that neither pointer is a script. A ball's
## addresses `db item, quantity` and a hidden item's `dwb event, item`, and
## before these dispatches existed `interact()` handed those bytes to the runner
## as opcodes. Two of them matter most: Ice Path 1F's HM07, since nothing else in
## either game gives Waterfall, and Cerulean Gym's MACHINE_PART, since nothing
## else opens the Power Plant and with it the Cascade Badge.

##
## What it proves, over every record rather than the two driven above: each one

## and the ask agree on the item and the flag for every one of them.
##
## What it does NOT prove, and the reason is worth keeping so it is not chased
## again: `_hidden_item_record` addresses the gameplay catalog's patch by
## `event_index`, and on an unpatched cache `_catalogued_item` falls back to the
## record's own byte, so a wrong index is inert over the whole corpus. It bites
## only where a mod has moved what is in a hidden item, and the read is stamped
## by `events_at()`'s own rule rather than by a second copy of it for that
## reason. Maps carrying more than one record are counted below because that is
