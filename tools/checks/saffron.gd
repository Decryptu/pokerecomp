## profiles. The city, the gym and the gate are byte identical between the pins;
## Route 6 differs only in the two extra Pokefans Crystal puts on (9,12) and
## (10,12), both sight range 0, so nothing here is profile split. Two things are
## worth pinning. Saffron has a real south connection to Route 6, but the city's own
## south row is wall everywhere that edge aligns to, so the gate is the only way in.
## And Saffron Gym is nine rooms with no walkable path between them, joined by
## fifteen pairs of self-warps, so the way to Sabrina is a fixed chain.
