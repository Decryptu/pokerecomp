## is drawn in, `Script_pokepic`'s [Gen2PokepicPage] and the battle screen's own
## 7x7 block.
##
## What a sampled case cannot say: `PadFrontpic` gives a 5x5, a 6x6 and a 7x7
## three different corners inside `PlaceGraphic`'s block, so a page that centres
## a pic instead is right about roughly half the corpus. Every species is drawn
## and its ink is required to sit inside the frame and above the interior's last
## row, which is the row `lb bc, 7, 7` leaves empty in an eight-row interior.
