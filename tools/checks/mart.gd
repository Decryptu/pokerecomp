## caches, over every mart the cartridge ships rather than a sampled one. Expected
## values come from the pinned sources' `MartTextFunctionPointers`, the twenty-nine
## `text_far` stubs behind it, and `MenuHeader_Buy`'s own geometry. One pinned
## address per cartridge finds every text, so what says the address is right is the
## content: each stub has to decode and each group's opening has to be that shop's
## own words. The screen itself is swept by drawing all thirty-four marts, since a
## name that ran past the list's columns is what a wrong geometry looks like.

## Enough of each group's boxes to say which stub decoded, without pinning a
## whole one. `bargain_sold_out` is the only refusal that is not shared.
