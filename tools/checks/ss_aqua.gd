## command profiles. All five maps' event tables are byte identical between the pins
## and every event flag below has the same number in both, so nothing here is
## profile split; only the text and Crystal's own gender branch differ. The crossing
## is one puzzle: B1F's two sailors stand on (30,6) and (31,6) and the coord events
## below them each move the visible one onto the player's own column, so the corridor
## west is sealed while the map scene is SCENE_FASTSHIPB1F_SAILOR_BLOCKS. Nothing on
## B1F opens it: the lazy sailor's own script is what retires both coord events.
