## Verifies every evolution row on freshly imported real caches against
## `EvolveAfterBattle`, for all three cartridges. The predicates in [Gen2Evolution]
## are what the field host and any link host share, so the census is what pins them:
## every row of every species is walked and answered rather than spot checked, which
## is what catches a method the importer misread or a predicate that answers the
## wrong branch. The real-cartridge counterpart to tests/unit/test_evolution.gd.

## data/pokemon/evos_attacks.asm, counted from the pins: every `db EVOLVE_*` in
## the file. Identical across the three, since no evolution changed between them.
