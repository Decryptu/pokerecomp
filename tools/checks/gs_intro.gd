## Verifies `GoldSilverIntro`'s art against freshly imported real caches, on all
## three cartridges. The section walk is what says the one pinned address is right:
## eleven entries in a row landing on their exact sizes, each rounded up to a
## sixteen-byte boundary to reach the next. This sweeps the imported result rather
## than the walk, so a cache built from the wrong offset shows up as a sheet of the
## wrong length. Gold and Silver ship the same art byte for byte, which is checked
## rather than assumed; Crystal runs `CrystalIntro` and is checked for saying so.

## `IntroScene10` drops Pichu's last tile on Crystal. Pinned rather than
## bounded, because the overflow is the finding. The count is what the structs
