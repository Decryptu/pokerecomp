## real caches, in all three games. Expected values come from the pinned sources'
## `PokemonCenterPC.Jumptable`, its `.WhichPC`, `PlayersPCMenuPointers` and that
## menu's own `.WhichPC`, plus the fourteen `text_far` stubs. One pinned address per
## cartridge finds all of it, so what says the address is right is the content: two
## runs of `@`-terminated strings, five lists whose entries all name rows those runs
## have, and fourteen stubs that decode. The three games ship the block identical
## bar the two boxes carrying a WRAM address of their own.

## `.Jumptable`'s strings, in its own order. The first keeps the `<PLAYER>`
## marker the cartridge stores.
