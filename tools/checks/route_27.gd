## Verifies why the walked route stops on Route 27, for both command profiles.
## `TohjoFalls.blk` is byte identical between the pins; `Route27.blk` is not, so its
## land census is profile split. Two halves. The first is geometry, and it is why
## this leg waited on Waterfall: Route 27's landfall region reaches no map edge, the
## only crossing east of it starts in a pocket that can only be left through Tohjo
## Falls, and the cave's two lower channels reach each other only over
## `COLL_WATERFALL` cells. The second is the way through: with the Rising Badge the
## climb reaches the pool in a single commit.
