## Verifies the TM/HM table and compatibility flags against freshly imported real
## caches, for both command profiles. Expected values come from the pinned sources:
## `TMHMMoves`, `GetTMHMNumber`, `GetNumberedTMHM`, `CanLearnTMHMMove`,
## `AskTeachTMHM` and `TeachTMHM`, all byte identical between the pins apart from
## one stubbed trainer-ranking call. The real-cartridge counterpart to
## tests/unit/test_world_tmhm.gd. The census is what actually pins it: every
## species' learnable set is compared against the table rather than spot checked, so
## a wrong flag bit order shows up at once.
