## finds every text, so what says the address is right is the content, the way the
## mart's own topic reads its stubs. The corpus half is the script sweep: the Name
## Rater's index differs by one between the two command profiles where the
## deleter's does not, so a wrong normalization shows up as a map reaching a
## different routine.
