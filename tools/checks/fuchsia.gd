## Verifies the walk south from Lavender Town to Fuchsia City and the Soul Badge,
## for both command profiles. Two findings carry the leg. The way south is four
## plain connections with one gate at the end, so what it costs is trainers rather
## than errands, and which trainers is not the same question as how many: shutting
## each sight line's cells in turn shows Crystal owes two of Route 13's five and
## nothing on Routes 12, 14 and 15, while Gold and Silver owe a different set. And
## Fuchsia Gym is a maze rather than a gate: none of its six objects is an
## OBJECTTYPE_TRAINER, and Janine sets her four disguised trainers' flags herself.
