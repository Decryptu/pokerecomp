## command profiles. Gym 2F's map events and `BlackthornGym1FBouldersCallback` are
## byte identical between the pins; Gold and Silver have no Dragon Shrine, so their
## B1F carries no warp to it and the shrine checks are Crystal only. What is worth
## pinning is not the scripts but the four places the leg would silently stop: the
## two boulders that seal 2F's pockets, the two 1F `changeblock`s that open Clair's
## room, the lake that is the only way to the Dragon's Den door, and the whirlpool
## between the den ladder and the shrine's one landfall.
