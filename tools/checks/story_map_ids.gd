## Verifies the profile map ids `tools/preview_world_story.gd` resolves by name
## against freshly imported real caches, for both command profiles. A map number
## counts from its group's first entry, so a map pokegold does not ship shifts every
## later number in that group: group 3 runs eight lower from UNION_CAVE_1F on. The
## route walker names only the maps it reaches by id, and only Ilex Forest is on a
## walked leg today, so a wrong number in the other three would be silent. Each row
## carries the map's own block dimensions from its `map_const`, which is what makes
## a wrong number loud.


## name: [crystal id, gold id, block width, block height]. The dimensions are
## the same on both profiles; only the number moves.
