## transcribed by hand, so the comparable artefact is the command list itself: the
## pin's `MoveEffectsPointers` in order, each label's commands resolved through its
## fallthrough, against [method Gen2MoveEffect.sequence_for]. That catches a step in
## the wrong place, which no unit test of one move can, and it is the static half of
## the battle-command trace an oracle runs against a real cartridge. A missing
## checkout skips rather than fails.
