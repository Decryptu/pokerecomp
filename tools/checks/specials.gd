extends RefCounted

## Sweeps every cached map script on all three cartridges for the `special`
## command and asserts that each index it reaches is one this project answers,
## or one of the named routines it deliberately does not.
##
## The class this exists to stop is a dispatch gap rather than a wrong reading:
## `Gen2WorldScriptRunner._execute_special` fails an index it does not name, and
## `_run_command`'s own `_fail` then stops the script where it stands, so one
## missing entry is a wall in front of every NPC that reaches it. Nothing else
## in the suite sees that, because a test reaches the specials it was written
## for and a story walk reaches the maps it was written for.
##
## `data/events/special_pointers.asm` is the corpus and the runner's own match
## is the claim, so the difference is derived rather than kept by hand:
## `EXPECTED_DEFERRED` names what is left, and a routine leaving that list is a
## line deleted here rather than a number edited.
##
##   Godot --headless --path . -s res://tools/validate.gd -- specials

## Every index the corpus reaches that this project answers with nothing, and
## the feature each belongs to. `Gen2WorldScriptRunner` is checked against this
## in both directions: an index here that the runner now handles fails, so the
## row is deleted with the work rather than left behind.
