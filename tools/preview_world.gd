## A fifth `live` argument photographs the real screen on that map instead, with
## the sprites the engine draws over an object staged on it: an emote over the
## first visible object, the boulder dust, the grass rustle and the headbutt
## tree. That mode drives the screen's own path and needs a display, so it runs
## without `--headless`:
##
##   Godot --path . -s res://tools/preview_world.gd -- crystal 26 2 /tmp/out.png live [kind] [x y] [WxH] [touch]
##
## `kind` may carry the player's own cell as `<kind>@x,y`, which is what a kind
## reading the two numbers as something else needs: `battle_transition@5,7`.
##
## `WxH` is the window to photograph in, for the two shapes a phone has, and
## `touch` draws the on-screen controller with it, which is the only way to see
## how [Gen2GameFrame] splits a portrait screen:
##
##   ... live effects 4 4 430x932 touch
##
## `zoom=<n>` and `framed` are the SCREEN FILL controls: `framed` photographs the
## 160x144 letterbox the hardware had, and `zoom=-3` the whole-region survey:
##
##   ... live effects 4 4 1920x1080 zoom=-3
##
## `view=<mod id>` photographs a registered renderer instead of the built-in one,
## which needs `--mods` in front of the `--` so the mods are actually loaded:
##
##   Godot --path . -s res://tools/preview_world.gd --mods -- crystal 26 2 \
##     /tmp/out.png live effects 4 4 1920x1080 view=voxel3d
##
## `kind` is `effects` (the emote, the dust, the rustle and the headbutt tree),
## `battle` (the wild fight `preview_battle_request` starts, settled past its
## transition into the fight itself, which is the picture a battle renderer
## staged on the map draws),
## `unown_wall` (`DisplayUnownWords`' box, read off a Ruins of Alph chamber's
## own wall pattern from the cell below it: maps 23 to 26 of group 3 say HO-OH,
## ESCAPE, WATER and LIGHT, as `crystal 3 24 ... unown_wall 3 1`),
## `cut` (`OWCutAnimation`'s two halves and the jump shadow), `mart`
## (`BuyMenu`, talked open from the cell in front of a shop's counter, as
## `crystal 1 8 ... mart 3 3`), `pokepic`
## (`Script_pokepic`'s box over the map, holding Chikorita),

## A so it wears the heart `showemote` puts over a map object),
## `warp` (`MapSetupScript_Door` at its whitest: the player is walked up onto the
## warp tile named by the two numbers below it, and the picture is
## `FadeOutToWhite`'s last order, which is the frame the new map is loaded on:
## `crystal 24 7 ... warp 7 1` is the bedroom staircase),
## `script_fade` (one of the five fade specials over the map, as
## `crystal 24 4 ... script_fade 46 6`: the first number is the special and the
## second how many of its frames to spend before the picture),
## `door` (`.CheckWarp`'s carpet: the player is walked down onto an interior
## door's mat and photographed standing on it, which the step itself no longer
## warps: `crystal 24 6 ... door 6 5` is the front door of the player's house),
## `ice_slide` (`DoPlayerMovement.CheckForced`'s run: the player is walked in
## one direction until the step lands on ice and the frames after that are the
## slide's own, with nothing held, as `crystal 3 61 ... ice_slide@16,8 2 40`,
## whose first number is the direction in down, up, left, right order and whose
## second is how many of the slide's frames to spend),
## `ledge` (the ledge hop at the top of its arc, walking south from the cell the
## two numbers name until one allows the hop: `crystal 24 4 ... ledge 5 4`),
## `map_name_sign` (`InitMapNameSign`'s window, raised by walking west off the
## map's edge onto its neighbour: `crystal 24 4 ... map_name_sign 1 8` crosses
## New Bark Town into Route 29),
## `yes_no` (`Script_yesorno`'s box, over the map's first script run to the
## choice it ends on: `crystal 26 3 ... yes_no 31 6` is Cherrygrove's guide),
## `name_rater` and `move_deleter` (`special NameRater` and `special
## MoveDeletion`, which no fixture cell reaches: the first number is how many
## presses into the routine to photograph, so 0 is the introduction, 2 its last
## page with the YES/NO up, and 4 the party list),
## `move_tutor` (`special MoveTutor`, driven the same way, except that it opens
## on `ChooseMonToLearnTMHM` rather than on a box: 0 is that list),
## `day_care` (the Day-Care's five specials, driven the same way: the first
## number is how many presses in and the second which routine, 0 the man,
## 1 the lady, 2 the man outside, 3 and 4 the two signs),
## `slot_machine` (`special SlotMachine`, which no fixture cell reaches: the
## first number is how many frames into the game to photograph and the second
## the bet, 1 to 3, plus 4 for the lucky machine),
## `tile_anim` (the map after the first number's worth of `AnimateTileset`
## frames, which is how the water, the flowers, the lava and the cave scroll are
## photographed at a chosen point in their cycle: `crystal 3 37 ... tile_anim 60`
## is Union Cave a second in),
## `card_flip` (`special CardFlip`, which no fixture cell reaches: the first
## number is how many frames into the game to photograph and the second the
## balance in hundreds of coins),
## `unown_puzzle` (`special UnownPuzzle`'s board, which no fixture cell reaches:
## the first number is how many frames in to photograph and the second which
## picture, 0 Kabuto, 1 Omanyte, 2 Aerodactyl and 3 Ho-Oh, or 4 to 7 for the
## same four solved; the empty cursor blinks off `hVBlankCounter`, so a frame
## with bit 4 clear has none on it),
## `visible_encounter` (a shiny of the map's own table standing on the eligible
## cell nearest the player, with the cartridge's sparkle over it: try
## `crystal 24 3 ... visible_encounter 4 9`), the name of any
## `preview_*` driver on the world screen without that prefix (`field_move` is
