## Every effect command one turn of a battle runs here, in the same shape

## It fights until one side is down, so the artefact is a whole wild battle
## rather than one turn.
##
## `DoMove`'s read cycle is [method Gen2Battle.run_move_effect] and its artefact
## is [member Gen2Battle.command_trace], so the two files diff line for line and
## a step in the wrong place is the first difference rather than a wrong number
## on a screenshot. The opcode is the pin's own
## `macros/scripts/battle_commands.asm` index, which this side does not carry, so
## it is printed as `--` and the name is what a diff reads.

## The matchup `.claude/oracle/battle/states/in_wild` stands in: a level five
## Cyndaquil against the level two Rattata that state walked into. The DVs and
## the generator are this side's own, so the two fights are the same shape and
## not the same numbers.
