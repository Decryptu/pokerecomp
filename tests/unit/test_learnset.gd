## What a Pokémon knows at a level, against learnsets copied out of the
## cartridges rather than invented.
##
## Two species cover everything worth testing. Golbat learns the same move twice,
## which is the duplicate check. Muk's list is not ascending, which is why the
## two questions give different answers: filling a fresh Pokémon stops at the
## first entry above its level, so a Muk caught at 40 is three moves short of one
## raised to 40.
