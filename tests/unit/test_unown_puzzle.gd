## Scene-free: [Gen2UnownPuzzle] is the board and its generator is injected, so a
## case is a scatter, a walk and a press. The corpus sweep on real cartridges is
## `tools/checks/unown_puzzle.gd`, which owns the art, the doubling and the
## thirty-six cells against four directions; the point of these is the branches
## a sweep cannot single out, which is every one that turns on what the cursor is
## carrying or on the order two presses happen in.
