## A world renderer that draws geometry instead of hardware tiles. The point is
## that nothing about the world requires the view to be 2D: it reads exactly what
## the built-in renderer reads and extrudes a solid per cell with a camera on the
## player. It answers `uses_hardware_viewport` false, so it gets the screen's own
## rectangle at window resolution, and the letterbox around the hardware-pixel
## boxes over it is this view's own to draw because the screen's cannot reach this
## layer. It reads the world and never writes it, so the two renderers can be
## swapped mid-step and neither can tell the other what changed.

## What mod.json declares, which is how the renderer names itself to the host
## when it reads its own settings back.
