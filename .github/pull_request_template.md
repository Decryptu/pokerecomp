## What this changes

<!-- One or two sentences. What behaves differently after this merges. -->

## Source references

<!--

anything that reproduces cartridge behavior, cite path plus symbol, one per line:

  engine/battle/core.asm, DetermineMoveOrder

Write "not source-derived" for tooling, docs, launcher or export work.
