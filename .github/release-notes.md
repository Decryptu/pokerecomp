<!-- Rewrite from the first release heading, `## Added`, `## Changed` or `## Fixed`, for each release. The text below
the release changes is standing guidance with a {VERSION} placeholder. -->

## Added

- Generation 3 trainers buried in ash now pop out with the ash puff and jump when revealed, then keep facing the way they turned.
- Generation 3 objects now run every scripted movement, including the Pokémon Center nurse's bow, Cut trees and Rock Smash rocks breaking, and the Acro Bike's wheelies, timed by each sprite's own animation.
- Generation 3 jump shadows now draw from cartridge graphics, follow objects at ground level and stop on landing or unsuitable terrain.
- Generation 3 maps now take on their weather's colours: rain and shade darken the screen, fog lightens it, drought glares, and warps fade in and out the way each cartridge does.
- Generation 3 rain, thunderstorms and downpours now fall and splash on the map, with lightning flashes, and the rain tapers off before the weather changes.
- Generation 3 cartridges remain unplayable while field integration continues.

## Fixed

- Generation 3 imports reject missing bridge reflection palettes and unterminated object palette tables.

## Updating this release

- Cartridges must be reimported for the updated cache format. Saves are preserved.

Every download is one file. `sha256sums.txt` covers all of them.

## First launch

- **Windows** may show a blue "Windows protected your PC" box, because the build is not signed by a paid certificate. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
- **macOS**: the app is ad-hoc signed and not notarized, so double-clicking it is refused. **Right-click the app, choose Open, then Open again.** Only the first launch needs this.
- **Linux**: `chmod +x pokerecomp-{VERSION}-linux-x86_64` and run it.
- **Android**: your phone will ask you to allow installing from this source.
- **iOS**: the `.ipa` is deliberately **unsigned**. Install it with [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or [SideStore](https://sidestore.io), which sign it on your own machine with your own Apple ID. A free Apple ID works; apps signed that way need re-signing every 7 days. Add pokerecomp's source once, in **Sources** > **+**, and every later release shows up as an update: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decryptu/pokerecomp/main/.github/altstore/source.json`
- **Switch**: extract the zip at the root of your microSD, so the file lands at `switch/pokerecomp.nro`, and launch **pokerecomp** from the homebrew menu. It needs a console that already runs homebrew; nothing here installs one.

## Updating

The launcher's about page tells you when a newer release exists. It does not install it: download the new file and replace the old one. **Your saves are kept separately and survive it**, on every platform.
