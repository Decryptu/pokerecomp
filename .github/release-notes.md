<!-- The top section is rewritten for each release; everything below it is the
standing text and only takes {VERSION}. One line per paragraph, per bullet and
per table row: GitHub reflows a release body to the reader's window, and a line
break put in by hand only makes it ragged. -->

## New in this release

Three things: one for Android, two for iPhone and iPad.

**pokerecomp has an AltStore and SideStore source.** Add it once and every future release arrives as an update instead of a file you download and re-install by hand. The URL is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decryptu/pokerecomp/main/.github/altstore/source.json`. In AltStore or SideStore, open **Sources**, tap **+**, and paste it. The app still signs on your own machine with your own Apple ID, and a free Apple ID still needs re-signing every 7 days.

**The Android back button no longer quits the game.** It used to close the app outright wherever you pressed it, mid-battle included. In the game it now opens the pause menu, or backs out of whatever is on screen. In the launcher it closes the sheet you have open, then walks back to the shelf, and only asks "Quit pokerecomp?" once there is nothing left to back out of.

**The iOS build asks for nothing.** The exporter wrote camera, microphone and photo library permission entries into the app whether or not it wanted them, and an empty entry is what a store shows you as a permission the app is asking for. pokerecomp uses none of the three, so all three are now removed from the build.

## Which file

| You have | Download |
|---|---|
| Windows, any PC from the last 15 years | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-windows-x86_64.exe` |
| Windows on a Snapdragon or Surface Pro X | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-windows-arm64.exe` |
| A Mac | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-macos.zip` |
| Linux on a desktop or laptop | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-linux-x86_64` |
| Linux on a Raspberry Pi, an SBC or an arm64 handheld | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-linux-arm64` |
| Android, including handhelds like the Ayn Thor | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-android.apk` |
| iPhone or iPad | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-ios.ipa` |
| A Nintendo Switch running homebrew | `pokerecomp-{VERSION}-switch.zip` |

Every download is one file. `sha256sums.txt` covers all of them.

## First launch

- **Windows** may show a blue "Windows protected your PC" box, because the build is not signed by a paid certificate. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
- **macOS**: the app is ad-hoc signed and not notarized, so double-clicking it is refused. **Right-click the app, choose Open, then Open again.** Only the first launch needs this.
- **Linux**: `chmod +x pokerecomp-{VERSION}-linux-x86_64` and run it.
- **Android**: your phone will ask you to allow installing from this source.
- **iOS**: the `.ipa` is deliberately **unsigned**. Install it with [AltStore](https://altstore.io) or [SideStore](https://sidestore.io), which sign it on your own machine with your own Apple ID. A free Apple ID works; apps signed that way need re-signing every 7 days. Add pokerecomp's source once, in **Sources** > **+**, and every later release shows up as an update: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decryptu/pokerecomp/main/.github/altstore/source.json`
- **Switch**: extract the zip at the root of your microSD, so the file lands at `switch/pokerecomp.nro`, and launch **pokerecomp** from the homebrew menu. It needs a console that already runs homebrew; nothing here installs one.

## Updating

The launcher's about page tells you when a newer release exists. It does not install it: download the new file and replace the old one. **Your saves are kept separately and survive it**, on every platform.
