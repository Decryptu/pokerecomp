# Mods

A mod is interpreted GDScript in a directory under `user://mods/`. iOS forbids
JIT and loading native code at runtime, so a distributed mod cannot be a
compiled extension.

Mods never touch scene nodes or engine internals. A mod is handed
`Gen2ModHost`, registers what it provides, and returns. Everything it can reach
is cartridge content through `GameData` or live world state through
`Gen2WorldAPI`, both of which are scene-free.

`GameRuntime` discovers and loads every installed mod before the first screen
exists, creating `user://mods/` when it is absent. The launcher lists what
loaded and names anything it refused.

A mod can be switched off without uninstalling it. `Gen2ModState` keeps the
disabled ids in `user://mods_disabled.json`, and only `load_discovered()`
consults them: a disabled mod is still discovered and still listed, it just
does not run, and that is not a refusal. Disabled ids are stored rather than
enabled ones, so a newly installed mod runs without an entry being written for
it and a damaged file means everything runs rather than nothing. Uninstalling
drops the id, so reinstalling later does not find it silently off.

## Layout

```
user://mods/<id>/
  mod.json
  mod.gd
  icon.png        optional
  thumbnail.webp  optional
```

`mod.json`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Lowercase `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*`; addresses the directory and registry keys |
| `name` | Shown to the player |
| `version` | The mod's own version, not the host's |
| `api_version` | Between `Gen2ModManifest.MIN_API_VERSION` and `API_VERSION`. Declare the oldest host you need: 12 for `Gen2ModHost.view_changed`, 11 for [the battle entrance](#the-entrance) and the battle view's other resolved fields, 10 for [a screen that fills the window](#a-screen-that-fills-the-window) and the maps past this one's edge, 9 for an item that names an evolution method, 8 for a stats-screen page, 7 for an actor's `interact`, `emote` and outbox and for hidden-item requests, 6 for `occupied` in the visible-encounter context, 5 for the run's rules, 4 for types, matchups, mod art and event mutators, 3 for mart rows and named axes, 2 for visible encounters, 1 for everything else |
| `entry` | A `.gd` path inside the mod directory, or inside the pack when there is one |
| `pack` | Optional `.pck` or `.zip` beside `mod.json`, holding the mod's files |
| `description` | Optional |
| `icon` | Optional path to the icon, when it is not one of the conventional names |
| `thumbnail` | Optional path to the thumbnail, same |
| `dependencies` | Optional object from required mod ids to SemVer ranges |
| `games` | Optional list of cartridge ids the mod is for |

Neither art field is an `api_version` change: a host that has never heard of
one ignores it, so a mod shipping art still installs on an older launcher and
simply has no face there.

`version` is a strict `major.minor.patch` number. Dependency ranges accept an
exact version, `*`, component wildcards such as `1.x` or `1.4.*`, comparison
chains such as `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`, and caret or tilde ranges such as `^1.2.3` and
`~1.2.3`. Dependencies load first. A missing, disabled, incompatible or failed
dependency, and every member of a dependency cycle, is refused by name before
the dependent entry script runs.

`games` is `RomRegistry` ids: `["gold", "silver", "crystal"]`. Absent or empty
means every cartridge the host knows, which is what a manifest written before
this existed says. A cartridge the mod does not name refuses the mod at load, by
name, and the launcher's card prints what a mod is for before Play is pressed.
Ids the host has never heard of are not refused when the manifest is read: a mod
that also names a cartridge a later launcher will ship has to install today, and
naming only such an id simply means it never runs here. There is no generation
shorthand, because a generation is not a fact the registry holds about a dump,
and a list of ids stays right when the launcher gains one.

An entry that is absolute, contains `..` or is not GDScript is refused before
anything runs. Manifests are read without executing mod code, so a launcher can
list what is installed and say why something was rejected.

A mod may ship its scripts and resources in a resource pack instead of loose
files. `pack` names a `.pck` or `.zip` beside `mod.json`, exported from
`res://mods/<id>/`, and `entry` is then a path inside that root:

```
user://mods/voxel/
  mod.json      { "pack": "content.zip", "entry": "mod.gd", ... }
  content.zip   mods/voxel/mod.gd, mods/voxel/renderer.gd, ...
```

`mod.json` itself stays a plain file, so the launcher lists a packed mod and can
refuse it without mounting anything. The pack is mounted only when the mod
actually loads, with `replace_files` false, so it can add paths and never land on
one the game itself ships. A pack that names a path rather than a file beside the
manifest, or that is neither `.pck` nor `.zip`, is refused when the manifest is
read.

```gdscript
extends RefCounted

func register(host: Gen2ModHost, manifest: Gen2ModManifest) -> void:
	host.register_world_renderer(manifest.id, load("%s/renderer.gd" % manifest.directory), "Voxel")
```

A mod that fails to load is reported through `Gen2ModHost.failures()` and
skipped. One broken mod does not stop the others and does not stop the game.

Two example mods are in `mods/examples/`, to copy into `user://mods/`:

| Mod | Shows |
|---|---|
| `voxel_preview/` | A world renderer. Switch it on from its page in the launcher, from the start menu's MODS entry, or with `V` in the overworld; it reads the same collision, block and palette data the 2D view reads and extrudes geometry from it, on the native layer with a translucent text box and one registered setting |
| `new_content/` | Every non-renderer surface in one file: a type and two matchups, a species with its own art, a move, a move effect, an item with its pocket and mart shelf, a named control axis, a visible-encounter population that reads the run's rules, two rebalancing patches, both event channels and the world channel's presentation mutator |

The repository examples are development material and are excluded from every
export preset. A distributed build contains the loader but no preinstalled mod;
players install their own copies under `user://mods/`.

## Installing

The launcher takes a `.zip` on every platform, through **Install** on its mods
page or by dropping the archive on the window where the OS offers that. The archive holds
one mod, at its root or in a single folder:

```
voxel_preview.zip
  voxel_preview/
    mod.json
    mod.gd
```

An archive is refused whole if it has no `mod.json`, holds more than one mod
folder, declares another `api_version`, or names a path that would write outside
its own folder. Nothing is written until all of that passes, so a refusal leaves
what is already installed untouched. Reimporting a mod that is present asks
first, and replacing one removes files the new version dropped rather than
leaving them behind.

Mods do not load in a headless run or one driving a `-s` tool script: a check, a
test tier or a screenshot would otherwise be measuring a renderer or a shuffled
table without saying so. Such a run still discovers mods, so a listing is right,
and `--mods` on the command line puts them back for a run that is about a mod:

```bash
godot --headless --path . --quit-after 30 --mods
```

Mods load the same way in an exported build as in the editor: the entry script
is plain GDScript read at runtime, even though the game's own scripts ship as
binary tokens. An installed mod loads immediately, without a restart, and so
does a change to the list: switching one on or off, deleting one, or choosing a
different cartridge reloads every mod against a fresh host.

`user://mods/` is the platform's `app_userdata/pokerecomp/mods` on desktop, the
app's `Documents/mods` on iOS (reachable in the Files app, since the export sets
`UIFileSharingEnabled`), and internal app storage on Android, where the system
file picker is how an archive gets in.

## An icon and a thumbnail

Both are optional, and a mod that wants either declares nothing: dropping the
file at the mod root is the whole of it.

| | File tried, in order | Size | Drawn by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Icon | `icon.png`, `icon.webp`, `icon.jpg` | 32x32, square | The launcher's list row and mod page |
| Thumbnail | `thumbnail.webp`, `thumb.webp`, `thumbnail.png`, `thumb.png` | 1280x720 | Nothing in the game; a listing site |

A manifest may name another path with `icon` or `thumbnail`, which is what a mod
keeping its art in a subdirectory needs. The path stays inside the mod folder on
the same rule as `entry`, and one that climbs out is refused as
`art_escapes_mod`.

32x32 is the party-icon grid the cartridge itself draws on, and the launcher
draws an icon at a whole multiple of it with nearest filtering, so the pixels
stay square. Anything up to `Gen2ModArt.MAX_ICON_SIDE` on a side is accepted and
never stretched to fill its box; past that, or past a megabyte, or not a PNG,
WebP or JPEG by its own magic, it is ignored and the row keeps the generic
glyph. A mod's art comes out of a stranger's archive, so every one of those is
an ordinary answer rather than an error.

An index row may carry `icon` and `thumbnail` as https URLs. That is how a mod
has a face while it is still only listed: the launcher fetches each one once, on
its own request so an icon never delays a download or a feed, and keeps it under
`user://mod_icon_cache/` so a listing browsed offline still has faces. An
installed copy's own file always wins over the URL.

## Publishing a source

A source is a JSON feed listing mods that stay in their authors' own
repositories. Anyone can publish one, and the game follows none until a player
adds it, because following a source is trusting whoever publishes it.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "name": "Example mods",
  "mods": [
    {
      "id": "voxel_preview",
      "name": "Voxel Preview",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Draws the map as geometry.",
      "games": ["gold", "silver", "crystal"],
      "download": "https://example.com/voxel_preview-1.0.0.zip",
      "icon": "https://example.com/voxel_preview/icon.png",
      "thumbnail": "https://example.com/voxel_preview/thumbnail.webp"
    }
  ]
}
```

`schema_version` must be exactly the version the build reads, because a later
format may reuse a field name for something else. Feeds and downloads are https
only: over plain http anyone on the path could rewrite where a download points.
A row with no `id`, no usable `download`, or an id that is not a legal mod id is
dropped, and the rest of the listing still works. `icon` and `thumbnail` are
optional and held to the same https rule; one that is not is dropped on its own
rather than costing the row.

`games` repeats the manifest's own list of cartridge ids, so a listing says what
a mod is for before anyone downloads it: the launcher prints it on the mod's page
and a site can filter on it. It is optional, and a row without one means every
cartridge, as an empty list in a manifest does. Only the shape is checked, a
malformed id being dropped on its own; the manifest inside the archive is still
what decides where the mod runs.

Pasting `owner/repo`, the repository page, a site root or the feed file all
resolve to the same feed, `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/index.json` for a
GitHub slug.

A listed mod installs through the same path an imported `.zip` does, and its
manifest id must match the one the feed advertised, so a listing grants a mod
nothing that picking the same file by hand would not.

A row whose `version` is newer than the installed copy's says so and offers
**Update** rather than **Reinstall**, and the status line counts how many the
listing offers. Both sides have to be strict `major.minor.patch` numbers to be
compared: a version a feed made up is reported as uncomparable rather than
guessed at, and a listing older than the installed copy is neither an update nor
an error.

Each feed's last listing that parsed is kept under `user://mod_index_cache/`. It
is what the mod list is built from, so the list opens instantly and offline and
the network is only ever asked when the player asks for it, on **Sources**. A
fetch that fails leaves the copy on disk up with its age said on the status
line. Unfollowing a source drops its cached copy with it.

The launcher's mod list is grouped by where each mod came from: a source that
lists a mod's id owns it, and a mod no source lists came from a file. That is
the whole rule and nothing records it, which is what makes removal mean two
different things. Removing a mod a source lists uninstalls it and leaves the row
behind offering the download again; removing one that came from a file deletes
the only copy there was, and is confirmed first. A mod listed by two sources
belongs to the first one followed, so it is on screen once.

## Adding content

`mods/examples/new_content/` is every non-renderer surface of the contract in one
file: it declares the current `api_version` and its newest surface is 9's, and
it registers a type and two chart exceptions, a species
with its own decoded art, a move and its effect, an item with a pack pocket, a
mart shelf and an evolution it causes, a named control axis, a world actor that
walks behind the player, a fourth page on the stats screen and a visible-encounter population that reads the
run's rules and refuses a cell something is standing on, patches two cartridge
rows, watches both event channels and rewrites the world channel's presentation.
Copy it and read it beside this section.

A content number is per kind and starts at `Gen2ContentOverlay.FIRST_MOD_NUMBER`,
which is 256. Every cartridge number fits in a byte, so a number that does not is
unambiguously not the cartridge's, and a mod's own numbers mean the same thing on
Gold, Silver and Crystal. Five kinds are numbered this way: `KIND_SPECIES`,
`KIND_MOVE`, `KIND_ITEM`, `KIND_TRAINER` and `KIND_TYPE`.

A type is the one kind numbered from zero, the cartridge's own chart being
zero-based, so `patch_content(KIND_TYPE, id, 0, ...)` renames NORMAL and a defined
type sits past 256 like the rest. It carries a `name` and `physical`, which is
which stat pair it uses: Generation II splits by type number rather than per move,
and a number past the chart has nothing to compare against, so a defined type has
to say. Special is the default.

```gdscript
host.register_content(Gen2ContentOverlay.KIND_SPECIES, manifest.id, 256, {
	"name": "VOLTLING",
	"stats": {"speed": 115},
	"learnset": [{"level": 1, "move": 33}, {"level": 36, "move": 85}],
})
```

A definition is partial. Whatever it leaves out comes from the kind's defaults,
which exist because readers index these rows directly: `palette.normal` and
`front_tiles` are read without asking whether they are there, so a definition
that omitted either would crash the reader rather than draw wrong.

Everything a species carries is a field on the one row, so a learnset, an
evolution, its egg moves and TM compatibility are part of the definition rather
than four more registrations. The engine then reads them the way it reads Pikachu's, because
every content read in the game goes through one place, `GameData._content()`.

An item may name the evolution using it causes (`api_version` 9), which is the
one effect a definition can give a field item:

```gdscript
host.register_content(Gen2ContentOverlay.KIND_ITEM, manifest.id, 256, {
	"name": "LINKING CORD",
	"field_menu": Gen2WorldPack.ITEMMENU_PARTY,
	"evolution": {"method": RomLayout.EVOLVE_TRADE},
})
```

A fact rather than a callback: the host runs that method's own predicate over the
chosen Pokemon and then the whole of `EvolveAfterBattle`'s tail, so the adapter,
the HP delta, a consumed held item and the moves the new species offers stay in
one place instead of a copy per mod. `EVOLVE_TRADE` and `EVOLVE_ITEM` are the two
methods a field item can name; an optional `"parameter"` beside the method is the
stone `EVOLVE_ITEM` looks for, defaulting to the item's own number. An item that
names no `evolution` behaves exactly as it did, cartridge stones included.

### Art

The pic atlases hold exactly the cartridge's own slots, so a defined species or
trainer class has no cell to point at and supplies decoded indices instead: two
bits a pixel, row-major, in the same 0-3 index space the cache stores, and exactly
`tiles * tiles * 64` of them.

```gdscript
host.register_content(Gen2ContentOverlay.KIND_SPECIES, manifest.id, 256, {
	"name": "VOLTLING",
	"pics": {"front": {"tiles": 7, "indices": front}, "back": {"tiles": 6, "indices": back}},
	"icon": {"indices": strip},          # or a cartridge icon number, 1 to 38
	"palette": {"normal": [0x7FFF, 0x0000], "shiny": [0x7FFF, 0x0000]},
})
```

A species drawing its own `pics` stands still when it is sent out: the wobble is
`AnimateFrontpic`, whose frames are the tiles the cartridge packs behind the
picture, and a supplied one has none. The cry still plays, which is the source's
own `.cry_no_anim` branch.

A trainer class names one `pic` rather than two. An `icon` is the party menu's
own strip, the eight tiles of its two 2x2 frames, or one of the cartridge's icon
numbers to borrow a picture that already exists. Art left out is not an error: a
species with no `pics` draws whatever its atlas slot holds, which for a number
past 251 is nothing, and `GameData.species_pic()` answers both kinds in one shape
so no screen has to know which it got.

`patch_content()` changes a row the cartridge does have. Only the fields named
change, and a Dictionary field merges, so patching one stat leaves the other five
alone. A patch of a number this cartridge lacks changes nothing rather than
inventing a row, which is what keeps a mod that patches Crystal's MYSTICALMAN
from conjuring one on Gold.

`KIND_ENCOUNTER` and `KIND_FISHING` are the cartridge's wild tables. They are
patched and never defined, since a mod can add neither a map nor a map header,
and their numbers are table coordinates rather than content numbers. Patch them
through the two helpers rather than counting the coordinate out yourself:

```gdscript
host.patch_encounter(manifest.id, &"grass", 3, 2, {
	"rate": 20,
	"slots": [[{"level": 50, "species": 1}], [], []],
})
host.patch_fishing_group(manifest.id, 1, {"rods": [...]})
```

A type matchup is patched by its pair rather than by a number, and is patch-only:
the cartridge chart is a sparse table of exceptions, so an absent pair is already
neutral and there is no row to define. `multiplier` is in tenths, the way the
damage formula divides, and `negated_by_foresight` is the Ghost immunities' own
rule.

```gdscript
host.patch_type_matchup(manifest.id, 256, RomLayout.TYPE_NORMAL, {
	"multiplier": RomLayout.MATCHUP_SUPER_EFFECTIVE,
})
```

An encounter row is what `GameData.world_encounter(method, group, number)`
answers, and the patched row is what every reader gets, including the region
walk `FindNest` uses. The method is one of `grass`, `surf`, `swarm_grass` and
`swarm_water`. `slots` and `rates` are arrays and replace whole; patching a map
this cartridge lacks changes nothing, exactly as a species patch does.

The four wild sources beside the map tables are patched the same way, each by its
own index in the cartridge's own table:

| Helper | Row | Index |
|---|---|---|
| `patch_treemon_set(id, set, fields)` | `GameData.treemon_set(set)`, which Headbutt and Rock Smash share | The set number `treemon_set_for_map` answers |
| `patch_bug_contest_mon(id, index, fields)` | One `ContestMons` row | Its position in the list |
| `patch_roaming_mon(id, index, fields)` | One roaming Pokemon | Its position in the list |
| `patch_fishing_time_group(id, index, fields)` | One day/night fishing substitution | Its position in the list |

Name only what changes. A contest row's `percent` is both the choice roll's
weight and part of what the judging reads, a rod entry's `threshold` is the bite,
and a roaming mon's `map_group`/`map_number` are where it currently is, which the
roamer's own movement writes; a patch naming `species` and `level` leaves all
three exactly as the cartridge has them. Every runtime reader goes through
`GameData`, so a patched row reaches the encounter roll, the treemon draw, the
Pokedex nest search and a visible encounter's context alike.

## The gameplay catalog

Everything else a cartridge hands out is a SITE in a script or a map event, not a
table: a starter, a gift, a static battle, a trade, a Game Corner prize, an item
on the ground, a badge and a shop. `GameData.catalog()` decodes them once and
gives each a stable id, so a mod places rewards without holding a single script
address of its own.

```gdscript
var catalog := data.catalog()
for row in catalog.rows(Gen2WorldCatalog.KIND_STATIC):
	host.patch_check(manifest.id, row["id"], {"species": 25, "level": 5})
```

| Kind | A row carries | Decoded from |
|---|---|---|
| `KIND_STARTER` | `species`, `level`, `item` | A `givepoke` whose script also shows the same species with `pokepic`, which only Elm's three balls do |
| `KIND_GIFT` | `species`, `level`, `item` | Any other `givepoke` or `giveegg` |
| `KIND_PRIZE` | `species`, `level`, `price` | A give site in a script that spends `takecoins`, priced by the branch's own take |
| `KIND_STATIC` | `species`, `level` | A `loadwildmon` with the `startbattle` that makes it one |
| `KIND_TRADE` | `trade`, `species`, `requested_species` | A `trade` command and the record it names |
| `KIND_ITEM` | `item`, `quantity`, `hidden` | `giveitem`, `verbosegiveitem`, an `itemball` object and a `hiddenitem` bg event |
| `KIND_BADGE` | `badge`, `engine_flag` | A `setflag` of a badge's engine flag |
| `KIND_SHOP` | `mart`, `dialog` | A `pokemart` command |

Every row also carries `id`, `kind`, its `bank` and `address` (or its `map` and
`event_index`), the `map` it stands on where the host could attribute one, and
`requires`: the events, engine flags and items the script tested before reaching
the site, read from the site's own branch rather than the whole blob.

`patch_check(id, fields)` changes a field of a row. It cannot replace the script:
the site still sets its own completion flag, prints its own dialogue, takes its
own money and runs its own battle, and only the number it hands over is the
mod's. Two mods patching one id is refused by the overlay's own ownership rule,
not by load order.

A field is effective at its whole TRANSACTION, not at one command of it. The
host links the commands a site's numbers also reach:

| Patch | Also drives |
|---|---|
| a starter's `species` | the `pokepic` its ball shows, so the picture and the Pokemon cannot disagree |
| a prize's `price` | its `checkcoins` affordability branch and its `takecoins` deduction, as one transaction |
| a trade's `species` / `requested_species` | both halves of the trade, carried beside the cartridge record rather than written into it, so a second site naming that record is unaffected |
| a shop's `items` | the shelf the counter sells, as `{item, price}` rows |

## Proving a placement finishes

A shuffle of badges and key items can write a seed nobody can beat.
`host.validate_placement(data, patches)` answers before anything is installed:

```gdscript
var result := host.validate_placement(data, {check_id: {"item": hm_surf}, ...})
if not result["ok"]:
	print(result["missing"])   # {check, kind, requirement}
```

`patches` is the same `{check_id: fields}` shape `patch_check` takes one row at a
time. The answer is `{ok, reached, critical, missing}`, deterministic, and it
installs nothing: a failed seed leaves the game exactly as it was, so a generator
retries against `missing` rather than guessing.

`missing.requirement` is one of `{map}`, `{item}` or `{badge}`, which is the
first thing that never became satisfiable. Behind it:

- `Gen2WorldReachability` floods each map's own collision grid from the cells a
  player arrives on, so an exit only Surf reaches is a Surf exit, and asks the
  same tile questions the overworld does.
- An HM is only a way past anything once its badge is in hand; the badge each
  field move needs is `Gen2WorldFieldMove.badge_for_move`.
- `catalog.possible_starters()`, `catalog.field_hm_items()` and
  `catalog.is_progression(row)` are the same facts for a mod doing its own
  planning.

What it does NOT model, stated so a mod does not read more into a pass than is
there: it is MAP-granular rather than cell-exact, and story `checkevent` guards
are treated as satisfiable because a placement does not move the scripts that
set them. Both are deliberate and both err toward passing a seed rather than
rejecting a good one. A site the catalog could not attribute to a map is taken
as standing where the player already is.

The catalog is DERIVED, not imported, so it needs no cache-format bump and no
re-import. It is also a decode of a corpus: `tools/checks/catalog.gd` pins both
the census and the semantics on all three cartridges, because a decode that
drifts into something still plausible is what a count alone cannot see.

Counts: `species_count()`, `move_count()` and `trainer_count()` are the
cartridge's own runs. Mod numbers are not part of them and are enumerated with
`Gen2ContentOverlay.defined_numbers(kind)`.

Two mods claiming one number is refused and named, rather than decided by load
order. `Gen2ContentOverlay.owner_of()` says which mod won a number.

What content does not get: a pic. The atlases are decoded from the cartridge and
hold its own 251 slots, so a defined species draws nothing until a renderer draws
it. `Gen2SramAdapter` cannot export a mod species to a real `.sav` either, since
the cartridge stores a species in one byte; the project's own save is JSON and
carries them fine.

## Adding a move effect

A move's effect byte is a number until something answers for it.
`Gen2MoveEffect` holds the cartridge's lists and `Gen2EffectCommands` the steps
one is built from; a registration is a list of those steps.

```gdscript
host.register_move_effect(manifest.id, 0xF0, [
	Gen2EffectCommands.USED_MOVE_TEXT,
	Gen2EffectCommands.DO_TURN,
	Gen2EffectCommands.DAMAGE_CALC,
	Gen2EffectCommands.CHECK_HIT,
	Gen2EffectCommands.APPLY_DAMAGE,
	Gen2EffectCommands.RECOIL,
	Gen2EffectCommands.CHECK_FAINT,
	Gen2EffectCommands.END_MOVE,
])
```

A list naming a step nobody wrote is refused at registration, where the mod's id
is still in hand, rather than pushing an error in the middle of a turn.
`register_effect_command()` adds a step of your own, as a Callable taking the
`Gen2Turn`; it cannot take a name the engine already uses, so a registration can
never quietly change what every move in the game does.

A registered effect replaces the cartridge's list for that byte, which is how a
mod rewrites Sleep rather than only adding to the table.
`Gen2MoveEffect.RESERVED_EFFECTS` is the exception: the multi-hit, fixed-damage,
Rollout, Selfdestruct, time-based heal and the two screen bytes are read back off
the turn by their own commands, so replacing one would leave that command
answering for a list it is no longer in.

## Watching what happens

`subscribe(channel, id, handler)` on `Gen2ModHost.CHANNEL_WORLD` or
`CHANNEL_BATTLE` calls `handler` with each event dictionary as the screen showing
it reads it, so a subscriber sees what the player sees, in that order.

A subscriber reads only: the handler is given a copy and nothing reads its return
value, so watching cannot make two mods fight over the same state. Events are
published from the screens, so a headless tool or a test driving the engine
directly fires none.

`register_event_mutator(channel, id, handler)` is the other half. The turn or the
script has already committed its state by the time these events reach the screen,
so the handler may rewrite what is SHOWN - text, animation, display values - and
is handed the whole event to return a changed copy of. Two things it cannot do:
change the routing key (`type` on the battle channel, `status` on the world one),
which would turn one screen operation into another, and share the channel. One
mutator per channel, because composing two rewrites in load order would make the
picture depend on which mod loaded first. A handler that returns anything else
leaves the event alone, and subscribers see the mutated event, not the original.

## Replacing the world renderer

Nothing about the world requires that the drawing be 2D: maps are node-free
`RefCounted` records, each tileset is one addressable atlas, animated tiles
replace atlas slots rather than map rectangles, and collision is a raw
permission byte per 2x2 walk cell. A renderer that extrudes geometry from that
same data is a registration, not a fork.

A registered renderer is a `Node` providing:

| Method | Called when |
|---|---|
| `set_world(world, animation)` | The map changed, or the view was created |
| `set_time_of_day(time_of_day)` | The clock crossed 04:00, 10:00 or 18:00 |
| `refresh()` | The player, an object or an event changed something |
| `refresh_animation()` | A tileset animation command changed tile data |

Registration is refused, by name, if any of these is missing or the script is
not a `Node`, rather than failing on the first drawn frame.

Six methods are optional, on either renderer kind:

| Method | Effect |
|---|---|
| `uses_hardware_viewport() -> bool` | Answering false moves the renderer off the 160x144 hardware viewport onto the screen's own rectangle at window resolution |
| `set_native_size(size: Vector2i)` | The native layer's size in window pixels, on creation and on every window change |
| `interface_opacity() -> float` | How opaque the screen draws the field of its own text box, 0 to 1 |
| `set_text_box_rect(rect: Rect2i)` | Where that box is, in hardware pixels, on every change and empty when none is on screen |
| `set_interface_masked(masked: bool)` | A screen laid out in 160x144 has taken the picture, or given it back. See [A screen that fills the window](#a-screen-that-fills-the-window) |
| `set_screen_rect(rect: Rect2i)` | Where the hardware's 160x144 screen sits inside the native layer, beside every `set_native_size` |

A view built out of geometry cannot be drawn into a 160x144 buffer and then
magnified, so the second layer is what makes a 3D or HD renderer possible at
all. Text boxes and menus stay hardware pixels over the top: the world gains
resolution, the interface stays a Game Boy.

The box is drawn opaque, as the cartridge draws it. `interface_opacity()` asks
for the field behind it to be drawn through, and only the field: the frame and
the glyphs stay ink, so nothing a renderer asks for makes text harder to read.
Around 0.75 reads well over a map. It is honoured only for a renderer that
answered `uses_hardware_viewport()` false, since one drawing in hardware pixels
paints the background itself and a hole would show the window behind the screen.

`set_text_box_rect` is the same box measured rather than styled, pushed on every
change including the empty rectangle when it goes away. The standard box is
twenty by six at row twelve, but a box can be any size and is not always up.

The world's own menus are not this box: the start menu, party and PC are
window-resolution panels with their own scrim, so a renderer neither sees nor
styles them. The pack's listing inside that panel is the cartridge's own screen,
drawn by `Gen2PackPage`, and is not this box either. `Gen2MenuPage` is the cartridge box path, used by the naming and
gender screens, neither of which is ever over a renderer.

A world renderer has a third:

| Method | Effect |
|---|---|
| `handle_world_input(event: InputEvent) -> bool` | Every input event the world screen did not use. Answering true consumes it |

The screen claims what it needs and offers the rest, so camera pitch, first
person and free-roam are all reachable while a movement or interaction key never
arrives: a renderer reads world state and must not write it, and moving the
player is writing it. Free-roam movement is the pose layer below, not this. An
open overlay, a running script, a battle or a trainer approach takes the event
first, exactly as it does for the screen's own keys.

Implement this rather than Godot's `_input` or `_unhandled_input`. A node in the
tree is offered events before the screen decides what it needs, so a renderer
reading them directly races the gameplay keys instead of taking what is left of
them.

### The tileset atlas

`GameData.world_tileset_indices(number)` is one tileset's graphics as a single
indexed strip, `Gen2WorldTileset.tile_count` tiles wide and eight tall, one byte
of colour index per pixel. Every number a block can name indexes it directly:
`Gen2WorldTileset.tile_index(block, tile)` is the strip slot, and
`Gen2WorldPalette.tile_palettes()` answers one palette per slot in the same
order.

The cartridge loads a tileset's graphics as two blocks of 96 tiles into separate
VRAM banks, and a metatile byte with the high bit set names the second. The strip
carries both, at the cartridge's own numbering: block 0 at 0 to 95, block 1 at
128 to 223, and the 32 tiles between them are the font's, always blank here. A
tileset that ships only one block leaves 128 to 223 blank. Nothing needs to know
which block a tile came from; the number is enough.

`Gen2WorldAnimation` rewrites slots in this strip, so a renderer texturing from
it follows water and flowers without knowing an animation ran. That is also why
geometry cut from the strip is cut from one arbitrary frame:
`tile_frames(tile)` answers every frame a tile is ever drawn as, in play order,
each entry that tile's sixty-four palette indices row by row, with the tileset's
own tile first and an empty array for a tile no command touches. It does not
advance the live sequence, since the running game shares the object. Ask it once
per animated tile when a map resolves, and let a mesh span the union.

### Asking what a cell is

`Gen2WorldAPI.collision_code_at(cell)` is the raw cartridge byte, and
`Gen2WorldCollision` answers what the source asks of it. Read a predicate rather
than a tile number: a pin by drawing is per tile id and per tileset, and the
cartridge's own answer is per cell.

| Call | Source |
|---|---|
| `permission_for(code)`, `is_walkable(code)` | `CollisionPermissionTable` |
| `talks(code)` | The same table's `TALK` bit |
| `grass_kind(code)`, `is_grass(code)`, `is_long_grass(code)` | `SetTallGrassFlags`, which is `CheckSuperTallGrassTile` then `CheckGrassTile` |
| `allows_hop(code, direction)` | `.TryJump` |
| `is_warp_tile(code)`, `is_pit_tile(code)` | `CheckWarpCollision`, `CheckPitTile` |
| `side_wall_face_mask(code)` | `GetMovementPermissions` |

`grass_kind` returns `GRASS_NONE`, `GRASS_TALL` or `GRASS_LONG`, because the
cartridge keeps the two apart: the long grass is its own pair of codes and the
Bug Contest doubles its encounter rate. It is `IN_GRASS_F`, not the encounter
gate; `CheckGrassCollision` is that one and it includes water, since one routine
gates a surf roll too.

### The drawn block of a map that is not open

`Gen2WorldAPI.drawn_block_at(x, y)` is the block a coordinate is drawn from
rather than the block that is stored there: `LoadMetatiles` substitutes the
map's border block for a `$00` byte, and `FillMapConnections` fills three blocks
of padding around the map with a neighbour's art where a connection reaches.

A caller with no world reads the same fold through
`Gen2WorldAPI.drawn_block_for(data, map, x, y)`. That is what a battle has: a
`Gen2BattleWorldContext` names the map and hands over no world, deliberately, so
an arena built from `GameData` records asks the static. The instance method calls
through to it, so the strip geometry and the north/south/west/east order at an
overlapping corner exist once. `tools/checks/drawn_blocks.gd` sweeps every map
of every cache over its whole padded rectangle and refuses a disagreement.

Live `changeblock` edits are the loaded world's own and are not visible to the
static form, which is correct for a map nobody is standing on.
`Gen2WorldAPI.block_revision` counts them, and a map load, so a view caching the
block buffer knows when to read it again rather than rebuilding per frame.

### The maps past this one's edge

`ChangeMap` copies a map into the middle of `wOverworldMapBlocks`, three blocks
wider than the map on every side. That margin is `BUFFER_BLOCKS`, it is what a
connection strip fills, and it is everything the cartridge holds: past it there
is nothing at all, which is why a 20x18 screen never needed more.

A view wider than that does. The connection graph is walked instead, and the
whole neighbouring maps are placed in this map's own block coordinates.

| Call | Value |
|---|---|
| `map_placements() -> Dictionary` | `"group:number"` to `{map, origin}` for every map the graph reaches from the loaded one, nearest first. The loaded map is not in it: it is the origin |
| `placements_around(data, map, hops) -> Dictionary` | The same for a map nobody is standing on |
| `connection_origin_blocks(source, target, connection) -> Vector2i` | Where one connection puts one map, which is the arithmetic the two above and the strip share |
| `expanded_block_at(x, y) -> int` | `drawn_block_at` inside the buffer, byte for byte; past it, whichever placed map covers the coordinate, and the border block where none does |
| `in_hardware_buffer(map, x, y) -> bool` | Which of those two answers a coordinate takes |

`PLACEMENT_HOPS` and `PLACEMENT_LIMIT` bound the walk at three hops and 24 maps,
which is as much as the furthest zoom shows.

`expanded_block_at` is the whole answer for a renderer with one tileset atlas
only if it never leaves this map's tileset. It does: a placed map is numbered in
its OWN tileset, so a block read across a tileset boundary is a different
picture with the same number. Read `map_placements()` and check
`Gen2WorldMap.tileset` against the loaded one where that matters;
`GameData.world_tileset(number)` resolves the rest, and `Gen2WorldMap.blocks` and
`border_block` are public.

`connected_map_objects() -> Array` is the people standing on those maps, as
`{object, offset}` with the offset in walk cells. They are read-only copies and
deliberately not part of `Gen2WorldAPI.objects`: `ReadObjectEvents` fills
`wMapObjects` from the loaded map alone, so on the cartridge a connected map's
people do not exist until its own map load builds them. They take the event-flag
and visible-hours tests and nothing else. No step, no script, no sight, no
collision, no encounter, and they cannot be talked to.

## Framing the view

`Gen2WorldAPI` offers a camera; it does not impose one.

| Method | Value |
|---|---|
| `player_position_cells() -> Vector2` | The committed cell plus any in-flight step, in walk cells |
| `visible_origin_cells() -> Vector2` | The framed view's top-left in fractional walk cells, centred on that position and clamped to the map |
| `visible_origin_cell() -> Vector2i` | The hardware page origin, which follows the committed cell |
| `view_pixels: Vector2i` | The drawn surface in hardware pixels, `VIEW_PIXELS` (160x144) unless a screen asked for more |
| `view_origin_pixels() -> Vector2` | That surface's top-left in world pixels, which is `visible_origin_cells()` scaled when the surface is the hardware's own |
| `player_view_pixel() -> Vector2i` | The player's pixel inside it, which is `player_pixel_position()` plus half of whatever surround a wider surface added |

The extra a wider surface adds is spread evenly around the screen the cartridge
would have drawn, so the player keeps the place `PLAYER_VIEW_CELL` puts him in
and only the surround grows. A renderer framing its own view can ignore all six.

`player_cell` commits at the start of a step, so the hardware page origin moves a
whole cell the instant one begins. That is what the 160x144 tile page wants and
what a camera does not: following it pans a step early.
`visible_origin_cells()` frames the interpolated position instead, and the two
agree whenever no step is in flight. A renderer that frames its own view, which
is what a free camera is, can ignore all three and read
`player_position_cells()` and `map_size_cells()` directly.

The host constructs a renderer per world, so the view can change while the game
runs. `Gen2WorldScreen.select_view()` is that switch, and `cycle_view()` is what
`V` is bound to: the map, the player and any running script are untouched,
because a renderer reads world state and must not write it. Two views of one
world have to agree.

## A screen that fills the window

A window is not the Game Boy's 10:9. **SCREEN FILL** (`Gen2Options.screen_fill`,
on by default, Settings > Application > Screen) grows the drawn surface to the
whole control instead of framing 160x144 inside it, and the overworld fills it
with more map: see [The maps past this one's edge](#the-maps-past-this-ones-edge).

**Everything the cartridge laid out stays put.** Text boxes, menus and the start
menu go inside a 160x144 rectangle centred in the surface and clipped to it, so
a mod reading `set_text_box_rect` reads the same numbers it always did.

| Read | Value |
|---|---|
| `Gen2Screen.expanded` | Whether this screen grew to its control |
| `Gen2Screen.view_size() -> Vector2i` | The drawn surface in hardware pixels |
| `Gen2Screen.view_size_changed(size)` | Emitted when it changes |
| `Gen2Screen.interface_layer() -> Control` | The 160x144 rectangle, positioned in surface pixels |
| `Gen2Screen.interface_masked` | Whether the screen is painting its own letterbox |
| `Gen2Screen.screen_rect() -> Rect2i` | The 160x144 screen in native-layer pixels, which is what `set_screen_rect` pushes |

**`set_native_size` may now be the whole control.** It was always "the screen's
rectangle at window resolution"; framed, that rectangle was a whole multiple of
160x144, and expanded it is not. A renderer that sized itself to what it was
handed needed no edit for this.

**`set_screen_rect` is where the Game Boy screen is inside it**, pushed beside
every `set_native_size`. That is what turns a hardware-pixel number into a place
on the surface, `set_text_box_rect`'s rectangle first: framed, the mapping was
the surface itself, and filled it is not. A hardware pixel `p` lands at
`rect.position + p * rect.size / Vector2i(160, 144)`.

**A native-layer renderer keeps the zoom keys.** `+`, `-`, `0` and the wheel step
`Gen2Screen.zoom_step`, and that ladder counts screen pixels per HARDWARE pixel.
A view that answered `uses_hardware_viewport()` false has no hardware pixel, so
the screen does not claim those events and they reach `handle_world_input` and a
mod's own registered actions as usual. Its zoom is its camera's.

**The letterbox is not painted over the native layer.** When a screen laid out in
160x144 takes the picture -- the pack, the party, the PC, the dex, the trainer
card, an evolution, a hatch, the day-care, the slot machine, card flip, a battle,
and `DoBattleTransition` -- the surround becomes bars rather than the world
behind it. That mask is drawn inside the hardware viewport, which composites over
the native layer, so raising it would crop a view that had already filled the
whole surface. It is not raised there. `set_interface_masked(masked)` is how such
a renderer closes its own surround instead, and the transition is the case it
exists for: twenty by eighteen cells cannot be widened, so a wedge reaching the
edge of a filled window is a shape only the view drawing that window can draw. A
renderer that does not take it keeps drawing what it was drawing.
`mods/examples/voxel_preview` draws the four bands around `set_screen_rect`'s
rectangle, which is the same shape the screen paints for a hardware-pixel view.

**A battle fills the window when its renderer draws the place.** `_BattleScene`
is a 160x144 picture with nothing to put in a wider surface, so the built-in
arena keeps the bars. A battle renderer on the native layer, staged on the map
the encounter fired on, has the same world the overworld was filling the window
with a frame earlier, and takes the setting with it. The HUD does not move either
way: the panels, the bars and the boxes are hardware pixels in that same centred
rectangle.

`Gen2Options.zoom_step` is the ladder's position, persisted because it is a view
preference rather than part of a run.

## Choosing the view

**Choosing a view is one choice.** `Gen2ModHost.select_view(id)` takes a mod id,
not a surface, and applies to whichever of the two renderer kinds that id
registered. Registering a world renderer and a battle renderer under one id is
how a mod says the two are one view of one world; a mod registering only one
keeps the built-in renderer on the other, and `gen2` selects both.

| Method | Value |
|---|---|
| `view_ids() -> Array[StringName]` | Every id that registered a renderer of either kind, `gen2` first and the rest in load order |
| `view_label(id) -> String` | The label the registration gave, drawn in eight cells (see "What a name is drawn in") |
| `view_surfaces(id) -> Dictionary` | `{world, battle}`, which of the two that id draws |
| `selected_view() -> StringName` | The chosen id, whether or not its mod is loaded |
| `select_view(id) -> Dictionary` | Chooses it, and persists the choice |
| `view_changed(id)` | Signal, emitted whenever the chosen id actually changes |

The choice is stored per installation in `user://mods_disabled.json` beside the
disabled list, so it survives a restart the way a mod's own options do, and it is
resolved every time a surface builds a renderer rather than once at load: a
stored id whose mod is uninstalled or switched off draws with the built-in
renderer and is not refused, and starts drawing again the moment the mod
registers.

**Every way of choosing reaches the same live screen.** `select_view` announces
the change on `view_changed`, and the world and battle screens rebuild what they
are drawing with on it, so the launcher's mod page, the start menu's own VIEW
row and `V` are one path. A mod neither needs nor should hold a screen; it may
connect to the signal to hear about a switch.

### What a name is drawn in

The start menu is the hardware's twenty-cell screen, so a name a mod registers
is drawn into a fixed budget and a longer one ends in the charmap's own "…":

| Row | Cells | What is drawn there |
|---|---|---|
| A mod's name in the MODS list | 17 | The manifest's `name` |
| A setting's `label`, and the VIEW row's own | 17 | `register_option`'s `label` |
| A setting's value, and a view's label | 8 | The chosen rung's label, a button's `press_label`, or `view_label` |

The built-in view is labelled "GBC 2D" for that reason. A name that has to read
whole in the start menu is written to those budgets; a longer one still works
and is shown cut, rather than drawn through the panel's border as it was before.
The numbers are `Gen2StartMenuPage.OPTIONS_LABEL_CELLS` and
`OPTIONS_VALUE_CELLS`. The launcher draws the full name either way.

**Players reach the view from three places.** The mod's page in the launcher,
where they already change what a mod does; the VIEW row at the top of the start
menu's MODS entry, which is the host's own row and appears as soon as more than
one view is registered, whether or not any mod registered a setting; and `V`
where [Gen2DebugKeys] is enabled. A mod must not register a view button of its
own: the host holds the one selection, and a mod's copy of it would be a second
answer to the same question.

**The switch is covered.** Building a renderer is a stall -- meshing a map can
land whole on one frame -- and nothing on one thread can animate over its own
freeze. `Gen2Screen.play_view_cover` closes with
`StartTrainerBattle_SpeckleToBlack`'s own scatter on the renderer that is still
running, builds the new one on the frame the screen is fully black, and opens
with the same frames backwards. It is around the switch rather than at a caller,
so every one of the three gets it, and renderers need nothing new: the outgoing
one is asked for no frame it would not have drawn anyway.

## Replacing the battle renderer

The same boundary covers battle presentation. `Gen2BattleScreen` owns the
battle, the events and the text box; it decides nothing about how a Pokémon,
a panel or a bar is drawn. A registered battle renderer is a `Node` providing:

| Method | Called when |
|---|---|
| `set_battle_data(data) -> bool` | The screen is ready, before the first view; a false return leaves the screen not ready |
| `set_view(view: Dictionary)` | The screen has new plain display values to show |
| `refresh()` | The renderer should redraw its current view |

`view` carries `enemy_species`, `player_species`, `enemy_unown_form`,
`player_unown_form`, `enemy_substitute`, `player_substitute`, `enemy_name`,
`player_name`, `enemy_level`, `player_level`, `battle_kind`, `trainer_class`,
`trainer_index`, `trainer_name`, `enemy_hp`, `enemy_max_hp`, `player_hp`,
`player_max_hp`, `exp_pixels`, `raster_scx`, `raster_scy`, `entrance`,
`intro_sprites`, `grayscale`, `enemy_trainer_pic`, `player_backpic`,
`player_backpic_palette`, `enemy_hud_visible`, `player_hud_visible`,
`trainer_hud_balls`, `trainer_hud_border`, `bg_map`, `bg_vbank1`,
`bg_palette_maps`, `ob_palette_maps`, `anim_sprites`, `anim_tiles` and
`hud_visible`: plain values read out of a resolved battle event, never the
battle engine itself, the same rule `Gen2BattleScreen`'s own setters already
followed.

`battle_kind` is `wild` or `trainer` and the three fields after it say who the
fight is against, which the species and levels do not. A wild battle carries
class 0, index 0 and an empty name, the way `wOtherTrainerClass` is zero there.
A class number is what `GameData.trainer_pic()` and `trainer_name()` take, so a
renderer standing the opponent behind their Pokémon draws the cartridge's own
picture of them; `trainer_name` is the trainer's own name from the party record,
not the class name. `exp_pixels` is a
count out of 64, which is `PlaceExpBar`'s own unit; the exp bar is never a
ratio, because `CalcExpBar` has already done the division and rounded it the
cartridge's way.

`raster_scx` is the background's own horizontal scroll, one value per scanline
in the order the hardware draws them, and empty whenever the background is
sitting still, which is every frame outside the opening slide. An offset is a
distance to look *right* into a background map 256 pixels wide against the
screen's 160, so a larger one puts the drawn content further left and the map's
blank columns wrap in behind it. `Gen2Raster.scroll(image, offsets, 256)` is
that operation and is what the built-in renderer applies to each of its layers;
a renderer that ignores the field simply draws no slide. `raster_scy`
is the same thing vertically, which only a battle animation ever asks for;
`Gen2Raster.scroll_rows(image, offsets, 256)` is that operation.

The last six fields are the battle animation layer. `bg_map` is `wTilemap`, a
20 by 18 grid of tile ids naming which tile of which battler's picture sits in
each cell: `$00` up is the enemy's front pic and `$31` up the player's back pic,
each `base + column * side + row`, and everything else is blank. A renderer
draws the two pictures out of that map rather than at a fixed corner, because
the map is what a battle animation edits, and `Gen2BattleScreenMap` is where the
constants and the plain seeding live. `bg_palette_maps` and `ob_palette_maps`
are eight DMG palette bytes each: colour `i` of palette `n` is drawn as colour
`(byte >> i * 2) & 3` of whatever the battle loaded, which is `CopyPals`. A
renderer that ignores all of it draws a battle with no animation in it.

`anim_sprites` is `wShadowOAM` as the animation left it, up to forty
`{ y, x, tile, attributes }` entries with the hardware's own byte values: OAM
subtracts sixteen and eight, so a `y` or `x` of zero is off screen, and the
attributes carry the x and y flips and the object palette slot. `anim_tiles`
says where each tile of the animation window came from, as
`{ gfx, tile }` counted from `Gen2BattleAnimObject.BASE_TILE`, so an OAM tile id
below that base is not an animation tile at all. `hud_visible` is false for the
length of a move animation, which is `BattleAnimClearHud` taking the panels and
both bars off the map and `BattleAnimRestoreHuds` putting them back.

### The entrance

A fight does not open with two Pokémon standing on the field. Two *trainers*
slide in from opposite sides, the opponent sends out first, the player's back
pic walks off, and a ball puts a Pokémon where each trainer was standing. Every
field so far says that in the terms the hardware draws it in: the slide is a
scanline scroll (`raster_scx`), the walk off is columns going blank in `bg_map`,
and the player mid-slide is eighteen OAM entries (`intro_sprites`). A renderer
with no background plane has none of those three, so `entrance` is the same
state said plainly, one entry per side:

```gdscript
view["entrance"] = {
    "player": {
        "kind": &"trainer",              # or &"mon", or &"none"
        "backpic": "kris",               # "" unless kind is trainer
        "trainer_class": 0,              # always 0 on the player's side
        "species": 0,                    # 0 unless kind is mon
        "offset_pixels": Vector2(142.0, 0.0),
    },
    "enemy": { ... the same five, with trainer_class carrying the class },
}
```

`kind` is what the square holds, and it is the whole of what a view drawing
`player_species` from the first frame is missing: `&"trainer"` a person,
`&"mon"` a Pokémon, and `&"none"` the stretch between the trainer walking off
and the ball arriving. `backpic` is what `GameData.player_backpic(kind)` and
`player_palette(kind)` take, `trainer_class` what `GameData.trainer_pic(number)`
and `trainer_palette(number)` take, and `species` what `species_pic()` takes, so
whichever one is set names a picture the renderer can resolve. A wild opponent
is never a trainer and slides in as its own front pic.

`offset_pixels` is how far that picture stands from its resting square, and it
covers both movements with one number because both are one thing: the slide
brings a picture in from off the field and `SlideBattlePicOut` takes it off
again. Zero is standing still, which is every frame outside an entrance. The
player comes in from the right and leaves to the left and the opponent the other
way, so the sign is the direction. A renderer that ignores the block draws
exactly what it draws today.

`intro_sprites` is the eighteen `{ tile, x, y }` of the player's own head and
shoulders during the slide, drawn as OAM because those three tile rows fall in
the band the opponent scrolls; it is empty outside the slide. `grayscale` is
true for the same stretch, since `GetSGBLayout SCGB_BATTLE_COLORS` runs only
once `BattleIntroSlidingPics` has returned. `enemy_trainer_pic` and
`player_backpic` are which picture is on each square, zero and empty once a
Pokémon has taken it, and `player_backpic_palette` is the `chris`, `kris` or
`dude` whose colours the back pic is drawn in. `enemy_hud_visible` and
`player_hud_visible` are the two panels one at a time, against `hud_visible`'s
summary of both; `trainer_hud_balls` and `trainer_hud_border` are
`BattleStart_TrainerHuds`' party balls and the frame they hang in, both empty
once the fight has started. `enemy_substitute` and `player_substitute` say the
doll is on the square rather than the Pokémon, which is the overworld
substitute sprite rather than any species pic; `enemy_unown_form` and
`player_unown_form` are one-based letters for Unown and nothing for every other
species, and a non-zero one means `GameData.unown_pic(form - 1, back)` in place
of `species_pic(number, back)`. `bg_vbank1` is `wAttrmap` bit
3 over the screen, the VRAM bank each cell's tile number is read from, which
only the enemy's own pic animation ever sets.

`entrance` and the twelve fields named in this section are `api_version` 11.
Before it they were pushed and undeclared, and one more was declared and never
true: `player_pic_visible` was a literal `true` in every view, because the
premise behind it is wrong. `CopyBackpic` puts the player's back pic on the
tilemap before `InitBattleDisplay` reaches the slide, so it is on the map
throughout. The field is gone; `entrance` is what answers the question it was
asked for.

The two HP values and `exp_pixels` are the *drawn* ones, not the committed ones:
a hit drains the bar over roughly a second the way the cartridge does, an award
fills the exp bar over one, and `set_view` is called again on every step of
either. A renderer that wants a bar to move needs no work; one that wants the
final number should wait for the animation to end rather than reading the view,
since mid-animation it is deliberately not the real value.

Registration uses the same refusal rules as a world renderer, and shares both
optional methods (`uses_hardware_viewport()`, `set_native_size()`), the one view
selection above, and the `V` cycle, bound in `Gen2BattleScreen` the way
`Gen2WorldScreen` binds it.

A battle renderer has two optional methods of its own:

| Method | Effect |
|---|---|
| `set_world_context(context: Gen2BattleWorldContext)` | Where the battle is being fought, once per battle, after `set_battle_data` and before the first view |
| `handle_battle_input(event: InputEvent) -> bool` | Every input event the battle screen did not use. Answering true consumes it |

`handle_battle_input` is `handle_world_input`'s twin and follows the same rule:
the screen claims what it needs and offers the rest, so a renderer can steer a
camera and can never take a gameplay press. A `Gen2Button` is routed to whatever
owns the screen before this is reached, on both sides, so the text box, the
forget-move list, the pack's own rows and ball selection each take their press
first and what arrives here is pointer and stick motion. Those three also
withhold everything else while they are up, because a press there means
something by itself. A draining bar, the opening slide and a move animation do
not: none of them reads input, and a camera that stalls whenever a bar drains is
not a camera.

`view` says what is on the field and nothing about the place, which is right for
the cartridge's white field and leaves a renderer staging the fight on the map
with nowhere to stage it. `Gen2BattleWorldContext` is that place, and it carries
`map_id` (group and number), `tileset`, `player_cell`, `player_facing` and
`time_of_day`, the last being the row the world was *drawn* with rather than the
clock's, so a battle entered from an unlit cave is staged in the dark.

It is a copy taken when the battle starts, not a handle on the world: a renderer
cannot reach live world state through it, and the two screens stay independent.
The map and tileset are numbers, which is what `GameData.world_map()` and
`world_tileset()` take, so a renderer resolves whatever records it wants through
the `GameData` it already has. A battle started outside the world, which is
every development driver, supplies none and the method is not called.

## Logical world state and optional mod pose

The game stays logically grid-based. The player and NPCs occupy walk cells,
movement commits one cell at a time in the four cardinal directions, and
interactions use the current logical cell plus one cardinal facing. Animating a
sprite between cells does not change that model.

A movement mod may add a more precise pose for smooth, analog, first-person or
3D movement, with a sub-cell position and an arbitrary facing angle. It is an
extra layer, not a replacement: the core world stays responsible for collision,
cell transitions, map triggers, warps and script or NPC interactions, and a mod
must not overwrite the authoritative cell or bypass those boundaries.

When a mod requests an interaction it projects its pose back onto the normal
rules: resolve a deterministic logical cell, quantize the facing angle to one of
the four source directions using the source tie-breaking, and pass both to the
existing interaction path. Smooth movement then leaves an NPC in the
neighbouring cell interacting exactly as it would on the cartridge.

## Putting one sprite in the world

A mod that wants a follower, a pet, a marker over an object or a ghost of a
previous run does not need a renderer: it registers a world **actor** and the
built-in view draws it with the map's own objects.

```gdscript
func register(host: Gen2ModHost, manifest: Gen2ModManifest) -> void:
    host.register_world_actor(manifest.id, Follower.new())
```

The actor is a `RefCounted` and never a `Node`, because it is a pose and not a
view. Three methods, refused by name at registration the way a renderer's are:

| Method | Called when |
|---|---|
| `set_world(world: Gen2WorldAPI)` | The map changed, or the view was created |
| `advance_frame()` | Once per world frame, after the player's step advanced |
| `sprites() -> Array` | What to draw now. A read: it is asked once a frame however many times the screen redraws |

Two more are **optional** (`api_version` 7) and offered only to an actor that
defines them, so every actor already written keeps working:

| Method | Called when |
|---|---|
| `interact(cell: Vector2i, facing: int) -> bool` | A press of A that no cartridge object, background event or tile branch answered. `cell` is the player's faced cell and `facing` the player's own; the first actor answering true consumes the press |
| `take_requests() -> Array` | The actor's one-shot outbox, drained once a world frame and emptied by the drain |

`interact` is offered **only** after `Gen2WorldAPI.interact()` answered nothing at
all, so a mod can never shadow a cartridge interaction. Only the actor's own pose
changes, so no player event is spent, and a pose the press changed is on screen
on the frame it was pressed.

`take_requests` is where an **edge** goes; `sprites()` is where a **pose** goes.
The one kind so far is `{"kind": &"cry", "species": n}`, played through the same
player a script's `cry` command and the Pokedex CRY button use. A mod may not
play a sound, so it asks and the host spends it, which is the bargain the shiny
pulse already has; no dedup window is needed, since the mod asks once. Anything
else in the outbox is dropped.

Each entry of `sprites()` is a dictionary naming cartridge art and nothing else:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `icon` | An `IconPointers` row, as `GameData.mon_menu_icon(species)` answers it |
| `sprite` | An `OverworldSprites` row instead, for an NPC or an object picture |
| `facing` | `Gen2WorldSprite.FACING_*`. Right is the left picture mirrored, as on the cartridge |
| `position_cells` | Where to draw it, in fractional walk cells, the unit `player_position_cells()` is in |
| `colors` | Optional. Four colours to draw the sprite in instead of the map's own sprite palette. What a visible encounter wears, so a shiny one is a shiny one before the battle starts |
| `emote` | Optional (`api_version` 7). `Gen2WorldActors.EMOTE_SHOCK` through `EMOTE_GRASS_RUSTLE`, drawn two rows above the sprite exactly as `SpawnEmote` puts one over a map object. State rather than an edge: it is up for as long as the entry keeps asking, so the mod owns the duration and the host owns the pixels, and a renderer reading `set_actors` gets it for free. An index outside the twelve is no emote rather than a wrong sheet |

The host resolves the strip, the palette, the time of day and the icon's own
two-frame animation (`.Frameset_PartyMon`'s rate), so a mod never composes
pixels. An entry naming art the cache does not carry is dropped rather than
drawn as a placeholder.

An actor's sprite is **presentation**: it occupies no cell, blocks nothing,
nobody talks to it, no trainer sees it and it is in no snapshot. That is what
lets it exist at all, since world state is the one thing a mod must not write.
Actors are sorted into the object pass by the row they stand on, so a follower
one cell below an NPC is drawn over it.

A registered world renderer that wants to draw them takes them through the
optional `set_actors(actors: Gen2WorldActors)`, which is handed the same
resolved list the built-in view draws.

### The map fades

A warp spends `MapSetupScript_Door`'s two fades, sixteen frames in which no
input is read. A renderer is offered each step of them through the optional
`set_fade(order: int, white_fill: bool)`: `order` is the palette order
`DmgToCgbTimePals` applies to every palette on screen, and `white_fill` is
`FillWhiteBGColor`, which the way out runs and the way in does not. The identity
order (`Gen2WorldPalette.FADE_IDENTITY`) is every other frame of the game. A
renderer that does not define it cuts to the new map on the frame the cartridge
is at its whitest; the host spends the frames either way.

## Visible wild encounters

A mod that wants wild Pokemon standing on the map instead of a roll on every
step registers a **provider** (`api_version` 2). It owns the population and
nothing else; every rule a cartridge owns stays in `Gen2WorldAPI`.

```gdscript
func register(host: Gen2ModHost, manifest: Gen2ModManifest) -> void:
    host.register_visible_encounters(manifest.id, Roamers.new())
```

A `RefCounted` and never a `Node`, with four methods refused by name at
registration:

| Method | Called when |
|---|---|
| `set_context(context: Dictionary)` | The map changed, and again whenever the player's pose moves |
| `advance_frame()` | Once per hardware frame |
| `encounters() -> Array` | The population now. A read, asked once a frame |
| `battle_finished(id: StringName, result: Dictionary)` | A battle this provider's entry started ended |

The context is a snapshot, never a live handle:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `map` | `Vector2i(group, number)` |
| `eligible` | `{grass, surf}` to `PackedVector2Array` of cells a wild may stand on. `CanEncounterWildMon` per cell: the grass test, the cave and dungeon branch that skips it, and the ice refusal |
| `occupied` | `PackedVector2Array` of the walk cells the map's own objects hold this frame: NPCs, item balls and every other map object, all four cells of a big one, and both cells an object mid-step is drawn across. Refreshed with `player`, not with `map`. Deliberately apart from `eligible`, which is a cartridge rule and never moves: an entry outside `eligible` is dropped, so folding the two together would delete a wild an NPC walks over. Refusing an occupied cell is the provider's own choice. The player's cell is not in it; `player` is where that is |
| `tables` | `{grass, surf}` to `{source, slots}`, the table a roll would read right now, with the swarm's and the Bug Contest's substitutions already made and the time of day already picked. A slot is `{species, min_level, max_level}` |
| `player` | `{cell, facing}` |
| `run_seed` | The run's own seed, so a population is reproducible |
| `generation` | Bumped on every map change: a context with an older one is stale |

Each entry of `encounters()`:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable across frames. It is what a battle result is reported back under |
| `cell` | Must be in `eligible`; which method it is in decides which table it is checked against |
| `facing` | `Gen2WorldSprite.FACING_*` |
| `species`, `level` | Must be offered by that table |
| `dvs` | The packed DV word, carried into the battle unchanged |
| `pulse` | Optional. Ask for the shiny sparkle over this entry |

Anything else is dropped rather than drawn, including an entry that names
`shiny`: shininess is `CheckShininess` over the DVs and is the host's answer.
At most `Gen2WorldEncounters.MAX_ENTRIES` entries are drawn in a frame.

What the host does with a valid population:

- Draws it through the actor layer, with the SPECIES' own four colours, shiny or
  not, so a renderer reading `set_actors` gets it for free.
- Turns the ordinary post-step roll off while any provider is registered.
  Scripted, fishing, Headbutt, Rock Smash, Sweet Scent and Bug Contest
  encounters keep their own paths.
- Starts the normal wild battle when the player steps onto an entry, with that
  entry's exact species, level and DVs, then calls `battle_finished`. Whether
  the entry survives that is the provider's one rule to document.
- Discards the population, its sprites and any running pulse on a map change,
  before the new map is drawn.
- Plays `ANIM_SEND_OUT_MON` with the shiny param over a pulsing shiny entry,
  anchored to it and with no battle field behind it, sound included. The host
  deduplicates: a request inside `Gen2WorldEncounters.PULSE_FRAMES` of the last
  one is dropped, so a provider may ask on spawn and every ten seconds without
  touching a node or the audio service. A pulse on an ordinary Pokemon draws
  nothing.

A world renderer that wants to draw the sparkle itself takes the optional
`set_encounters(encounters: Gen2WorldEncounters)`; the population itself already
arrives through `set_actors`.

## Hidden items a mod can see, and ask for

A mod that wants something of its own to pick a hidden item up, a follower
walking over one or a detector drawing them, reads them and **asks** for one
(`api_version` 7). It never takes one: taking one writes the bag, the event flag
and the save, and runs `hiddenitem`'s own `verbosegiveitem` with its FOUND text,
its fanfare and its pack-full branch, all of which is world state a mod must not
write.

`Gen2WorldAPI.hidden_items()` is the read: one entry per `BGEVENT_ITEM` on the
current map, taken or not. Scene-free, like `visible_encounter_cells()` beside
it, so a probe can walk a map and print them with no game running.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `cell` | Where the record sits |
| `item` | The item it gives, with the gameplay catalog's patch already applied |
| `flag` | Its own event flag, which is the site's completion |
| `taken` | `event_flag_active(flag)`. The Itemfinder's own test |

`Gen2ModHost.request_hidden_item(cell)` is the ask. The mod names a cell and
reads nothing back: the host validates it against that same list and, on the
next world frame nothing else owns, runs the map's **own** script through the
ordinary path, so the text box, the fanfare and the pacing are the world
screen's exactly as they are for a player walking onto the cell. It is the same
bargain a visible-encounter provider has with a wild battle: the mod names the
entry, the host runs it.

- An ask for a cell with no record, or one whose flag is already set, does
  nothing. `CheckBGEventFlag` is the host's test, not the mod's.
- One is spent per frame, since the first one's script owns the world until its
  box is pressed past; the rest wait in the queue in order.
- An ask made inside a battle, a text box, a warp or an overlay is spent when the
  world can spend it rather than dropped.

Which cell to name is the mod's own business.

## Measured against the voxel mod

[DramaticShapeVoxelMod](https://github.com/DramaticShape/DramaticShapeVoxelMod)
is the reference for what a renderer mod has to be able to do: a voxel diorama
with selectable camera pitch, first and third person, VR, reflections and a day
cycle, shipping no cartridge art. Everything it needs is in the contract above.
Geometry comes from collision permissions, the block grid and the tileset atlas;
the view runs at window resolution; animated tiles follow because
`Gen2WorldAnimation` replaces atlas slots rather than map rectangles.

Movement is the one part worth naming. `Gen2WorldAPI.player_step_offset_cells()`
and `Gen2WorldObject.step_offset_cells()` return an in-flight step as a
fractional cell, from one cell behind the committed cell down to zero. The
logical cell commits at the start of the step; the fraction is presentation only
and never reaches collision, events or the snapshot. `applymovement` applies its
whole stream at once, so a scripted path commits together and the offset trails
by as many cells as are left to draw; `advance_scripted_steps_pass()` drains
that trail, 16 overworld passes a step for the slow commands, 8 for plain, 4 for
bike speed. A pass is two hardware frames
(`Gen2WorldAPI.FRAMES_PER_OVERWORLD_PASS`, `MaxOverworldDelay`), so a plain step
covers its cell in sixteen of them. `Gen2WorldObject.frame` is the cartridge's
`Facings` index, 0 to 3, changing every four passes the way
`SetFacingStepAction` does.
`mods/examples/voxel_preview/` reads all of it.

A hop is the one step with a second axis.
`Gen2WorldAPI.player_height_offset_pixels()` and
`Gen2WorldObject.height_offset_pixels()` return how far above the ground the
sprite is drawn, in world pixels and positive upward, which is
`UpdateJumpPosition`'s own `.y_offsets` table over the step's frames. It is zero
at rest, zero on every ordinary step, and zero again on the frame the hop
completes; only a ledge hop and the three `jump_step` movement commands raise it,
and each of those covers two cells over twice its command's frames. Presentation
only, like the horizontal offset beside it: the cell, the collision, the triggers
and the snapshot are at the landing cell for the whole arc.

Not covered: the teleport, skyfall and dig step types. `teleport_from`,
`teleport_to`, `skyfall` and `step_dig` reach the caller as a
`movement_command_requested` event and change nothing. None moves a cell on the
cartridge either, each being a spin, a rise or a fall over a fixed frame count
(`StepFunction_TeleportFrom` and its neighbours), so each is a pose a renderer
has to be told about rather than an offset it can read.

**Per-block height is deliberately not a host boundary.** A renderer resolves
shape from the collision permissions, the block grid and the tileset, all
already public, and keeps whatever table it needs beside its own resolver. A
host-side one would be a second place for the same facts.

## Adding a menu entry

`register_menu_entry(menu, id, entry)` appends to a menu the game builds. The
cartridge's own entries are never registered, so a mod can add but not reorder
or remove them.

| Menu | Where the entry lands | `entry` keys |
|---|---|---|
| `Gen2ModHost.MENU_START` | the start menu, immediately before EXIT | `label`, optional `handler: Callable` |
| `Gen2ModHost.MENU_PACK_POCKET` | after the pack's four source pockets | `label`, `pocket` |
| `Gen2ModHost.MENU_MART` | after a mart's cartridge shelf | `label`, `item`, optional `price`, optional `available(mart)` |

```gdscript
func register(host: Gen2ModHost, manifest: Gen2ModManifest) -> void:
	host.register_menu_entry(Gen2ModHost.MENU_START, manifest.id, {
		"label": "Atlas",
		"handler": func() -> void: print("opened"),
	})
```

A start-menu entry without a handler still appears, marked unavailable. A
pocket's number has to be at or
above `Gen2ModHost.FIRST_MOD_POCKET`: 1 to 4 are the cartridge's ITEM, KEY_ITEM,
BALL and TM_HM, and an item joins the pocket its own definition names. Two mods
claiming the same entry id is refused with `duplicate_menu_entry` rather than one
silently winning.

A mart filter receives the resolved mart dictionary, including `mart_id`,
`dialog_id` and `variant`. Its row is omitted when the filter answers false or
the source shelf already sells that item. Selection still goes through the
ordinary mart transaction, including money, stack limits and save validation.

## Adding a row to a party member's menu

`register_party_member_menu(id, entry)` appends to the box a party slot opens.
Both halves are Callables taking the ONE-based slot, because a row here is about
a member rather than about the menu:

```gdscript
host.register_party_member_menu(manifest.id, {
	"label": func(slot: int) -> String:
		return "FOLLOWING" if slot == following_slot else "FOLLOW",
	"handler": func(slot: int) -> void:
		host.set_option(manifest.id, &"slot", slot),
})
```

Rows land after every cartridge action and before CANCEL, which is the way out
of the box; a mod cannot displace or reorder a cartridge row, and the list still
stops at the source's own `NUM_MONMENU_ITEMS`. A label answering an empty string
drops its own row, which is how a row is shown conditionally. Choosing one calls
the handler and closes the menu, the way a field move does.

Not offered for an egg, and not offered inside a battle: a battle's party list is
a switch, and a row running a mod's action in the middle of a turn would be world
state changing while the turn owns it.

## Adding a page to the stats screen

`register_stats_page(id, {"build": Callable})` adds a page after the cartridge's
pink, green and blue. `build` takes the screen's snapshot and answers placements
on its own 20x18 tile grid; the host writes them with the screen's font, so the
page needs no node, no renderer and no art:

```gdscript
host.register_stats_page(manifest.id, {
	"build": func(page: Dictionary) -> Array:
		return [
			{"divider": 10},
			{"text": "DV", "at": Vector2i(7, 8)},
			{"text": str(Gen2Stats.attack_dv(int(page["dvs"]))), "at": Vector2i(7, 9)},
		],
})
```

| Placement | Draws |
|---|---|
| `{"text": String, "at": Vector2i}` | the string at that tile |
| `{"divider": int}` | the pink and blue pages' own vertical divider down that column |

The lower half is rows 8 to 17 and a placement outside it is dropped, which is
what keeps a page off the upper half's name, level and front pic. The snapshot is
`Gen2MonStatsScreen.snapshot`, which carries `dvs` (the packed word,
`Gen2Stats.attack_dv` and friends read it) and `stat_exp` (keyed `hp`, `attack`,
`defense`, `speed`, `special`) beside everything the cartridge pages print.

Pages turn with LEFT and RIGHT and wrap, A on the last page leaves the screen,
and the 2x2 page indicators are centred against the right arrow with the left
arrow moving to meet them. Five pages is the ceiling
(`Gen2StatsScreenPage.MAX_PAGES`): a sixth block reaches the front pic. Past it
registration is refused with `stats_pages_full`, and a second mod claiming one id
with `duplicate_stats_page`. An egg has no pages at all, so a registered one is
not reached for it, the way the cartridge's own are not.

## Holding a run rather than an installation

A mod whose settings decide what a whole playthrough looks like has a problem
`read_save_data` alone does not solve: an installation option changed mid-run
would silently rewrite the save being played, and opening another save could not
restore the settings that made it. `register_save_lifecycle(manifest, provider)`
is the seam for that.

The `manifest` is the object `register()` was handed, and it IS the capability:
the host keeps it beside the provider, so a callback reaches
`read_save_data`/`write_save_data` for its own namespace and no other mod's. A
manifest this host never discovered registers nothing.

| Method | Called when |
|---|---|
| `save_created(save)` | A save has just been made, before it is written. Snapshot whatever the run is built from into your namespace here |
| `save_activated(save)` | That save is about to be played. `save` is `null` for a DEVELOPMENT run, one started with no selected slot |
| `save_deactivated()` | The save was closed |

Ordering, which is the part that matters:

1. The host drops every lifecycle mod's overlay contributions, in one pass.
2. `save_activated` runs, in registration order.

So a provider always starts from the cartridge, two slots cannot leak patches
into one another, and a provider that fails leaves nothing installed rather than
the previous run's shuffle. `save_deactivated` clears afterwards, so nothing
stays patched by a run nobody is playing.

Save the compact INPUTS plus an algorithm version, not the generated plan: a plan
can exceed the 64 KiB namespace and duplicates cartridge rows anyway. A save
carrying no snapshot has no run and should stay vanilla rather than adopt today's
options.

Registered settings need none of that. The host snapshots them onto the save
itself (`Gen2SaveData.run_options`) when it is created, binds that snapshot while
the slot is played, and puts a change made mid-run into the save rather than into
the installation. So `host.option()` answers with what THIS run is played with,
the launcher edits the installation with no slot open, and a slot written before
the snapshot existed adopts the installation once, when it is first activated.

## Reading the run's rules

`world.rules` is a `Gen2Rules`: which of the cartridge's own bugs this run
reproduces, and its trainer-AI difficulty. Read it, do not write it. A rule that
changed mid-run would make the save it produced unreproducible, which is the
whole reason the rules belong to the run rather than to the installation.

```gdscript
if world.rules.reproduces(&"metal_powder_overflow"):
	...
if world.rules.difficulty == Gen2Rules.DIFFICULTY_HARD:
	...
```

`Gen2Rules.FLAGS` is every flag this build names, mapped to what it does by
default. Each is named for the HARDWARE's behaviour, so a flag that is on means
the cartridge's bug is reproduced and off means this project's corrected answer is
used. An unknown flag answers false rather than failing, so a mod written against
a later build still runs.

The same object is on a battle (`battle.rules`), and exactly one set is installed
at a time (`Gen2Rules.active()`) because the damage formula and the experience
curves are statics with no engine object to read it off.

## Adding a setting

`register_option(id, option)` describes one setting: a ladder of values, a
number in a range, or a button. The
game and the launcher each build a surface from that one registration, so a mod
writes no settings screen and the two can never disagree.

```gdscript
host.register_option(manifest.id, {
	"key": "draw_distance", "label": "DISTANCE",
	"values": [8, 16, 24, 0], "labels": ["8", "16", "24", "FULL"],
	"default": 16,
})
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key` | Addresses the setting within the mod |
| `label` | Shown to the player |
| `kind` | Optional; `Gen2ModHost.OPTION_LADDER` (the default), `OPTION_NUMBER` or `OPTION_BUTTON` |
| `values` | The rungs, at least one. A toggle is a two-rung ladder. Ladder only |
| `labels` | Optional; what each rung is shown as, defaulting to the values |
| `minimum`, `maximum` | The range, inclusive. Number only |
| `step` | Optional; what one press moves the value by, defaulting to 1. Number only |
| `default` | Optional; the rung or the number used until the player picks one, defaulting to the first rung or the minimum |
| `press_label` | Optional; what a button setting's control reads, defaulting to `Go`. Button only |

A **number** setting is one whole value in a range rather than a ladder with
every rung written out: a randomizer's seed is one field with ten thousand
values, and dialling it as four one-digit ladders spends four menu rows on one
value. Set it with `set_option(id, key, value)`, clamped into the range as
registered now, or step it with `adjust_option(id, key, delta)`, which is what
both surfaces call and which steps a ladder just as well. The launcher draws it
as a field that can be typed into; the start menu steps it left and right.

A **button** setting is a press rather than a ladder, for something with no value
to keep: "recentre the camera now" is an action, not a rung. It stores nothing,
`press_option(id, key)` is what both surfaces call, and `option_changed` carries
a null value to say the press is the whole setting.

Read it back with `host.option(id, key)`, or `option_index(id, key)` for the
rung, which is -1 for anything that is not a ladder.
A mod that has to rebuild something on a change connects to `option_changed(id,
key, value)` rather than polling. The host keeps the entry object `register` was
called on for as long as the mod is loaded, so connecting a signal to it is safe
and a mod does not have to hold itself in a static variable: `mods/examples/voxel_preview/` registers a
camera setting in `mod.gd` and its renderer reads it once and then listens.

The two surfaces are a **MODS** entry in the start menu, beside the pack and the
save, and rows on that mod's card in the launcher's mods page. The entry appears
only when at least one loaded mod registered a setting, so a player with no mods
sees the cartridge's menu exactly.

A change is committed the moment it is made, the way the cartridge's own OPTION
menu writes each press to `wOptions`. With no slot open it lands in
`user://mod_options.json`, keyed by mod id: that file is the installation's own
values and the template a new run is created from. While a slot is played the
change belongs to the slot instead (`run_options`, see "Holding a run rather than
an installation"), because a draw distance that moved under a loaded save would
make that save's own recorded walk unreproducible. Only values are stored, never
what a setting means, so a mod that drops a rung in a later version finds its
stored value refused and its default used instead, and uninstalling a mod drops
what it stored.

Per-slot state belongs in the save instead. A discovered manifest can use
`host.read_save_data(manifest, save)` and
`host.write_save_data(manifest, save, value)` to access only its own namespace.
Both sides deep-copy dictionaries, and writes larger than 64 KiB of UTF-8 JSON
are refused. The manifest object itself is the capability: constructing another
manifest with the same id does not grant access to that mod's state.

## Adding a control

`register_action(id, action)` declares a control of the mod's own. A mod cannot
see the cartridge's eight, and the screen claims every one of them before a
renderer is offered anything, so reading raw keycodes out of
`handle_world_input` produces controls that cannot be rebound, collide silently
with the d-pad, and do not exist on a touchscreen at all.

```gdscript
host.register_action(manifest.id, {
	"key": "pitch_up", "label": "Camera up",
	"default": [{"kind": "key", "code": KEY_F}],
})
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key` | Addresses the control within the mod |
| `label` | Shown wherever the control is listed or drawn |
| `default` | Optional; bindings in `Gen2InputActions`' own shape |

`default` takes the same three kinds the eight take, so a mod's control binds to
a key by physical position, a pad button, or a stick axis past the same deadzone:

```gdscript
{"kind": "key",        "code": <physical keycode>}
{"kind": "pad_button", "code": <JoyButton>}
{"kind": "pad_axis",   "code": <JoyAxis>, "sign": -1 or 1}
```

A default already bound to one of the eight is **dropped and reported**, because
such a binding would never once fire: the screen takes those first. The action
still registers, unbound on that slot, and the refusal reaches
`Gen2ModHost.failures()` and the launcher. `W`, `A`, `S` and `D` are the d-pad's
own default keys.

Three ways to read one, none of them an `InputEvent`:

| Call | For |
|---|---|
| `action_changed(id, key, pressed)` | The edge. A signal, like `option_changed` |
| `action_held(id, key) -> bool` | The poll a camera wants |
| `action_strength(id, key) -> float` | The same as a magnitude, 0 to 1 |
| `action_axis(id, negative, positive) -> float` | Two named actions as one signed axis |
| `action_vector(id, left, right, up, down) -> Vector2` | Two named axes, limited to unit length |

`action_strength` is what makes an analogue control analogue: a stick bound to an
action answers its travel past the deadzone, so a camera on the right stick moves
at the rate the player is pushing it, while a key answers 0 or 1. Cameras can
compose four such actions through `action_vector`; a two-finger drag remains a
raw `handle_world_input` or `handle_battle_input` leftover.

Everything a registered control reaches is reachable without a keyboard:

- the launcher's **controls** card lists a loaded mod's actions in their own
  group under the eight, and rebinds them through the same sheet;
- the on-screen controller can carry them. Off by default, because a mod must
  not cover the screen of a player who never asked for one; switched on from the
  same card, each is a pill the player drags where they like, per orientation,
  beside A and B.

An event reaches a mod's action only where the screen would have offered a
renderer one, so an open menu, a running script, a battle or a trainer approach
takes the press first.

## Not built yet

A mod species does not appear in the Pokedex: both dex order tables are cartridge
data of exactly 251 entries, and nothing splices `defined_numbers()` into them,
though a mod species that replaces a cartridge one does carry its own dex entry.
Mod content cannot leave the project's own save either: every species, item and
move on the hardware is one byte, so `Gen2SramAdapter` refuses to export a save
carrying any of it rather than truncating a number into a different Pokemon.
