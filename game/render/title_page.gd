## The title screen, on the tile grid the hardware uses. Two screens under one
## name, the way [Gen2TitleScene] is: Crystal draws its logo with
## `DrawTitleGraphic`, keeps a strip of Suicune under it that `LoadSuicuneFrame`
## re-points every eighth frame, and stands the crystal in front as thirty 8x16
## objects, while Gold and Silver write `TitleScreenTilemap` straight into the BG
## map and fly one bird over it. [Gen2TitleScene] owns the frames and the
## positions; this owns the pixels.
