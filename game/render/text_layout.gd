## Breaking a string into the lines and pages a text box can show. Pure rules, no
## font and no screen: it counts tiles and returns strings, so a conversation's
## pagination can be checked without drawing anything. Widths count tiles, never
## characters: a ligature like "'s" is two characters in one glyph, so
## [method String.length] overstates a line and wraps it a column early. The
## cartridges do not wrap at runtime, their text being pre-broken at authoring
## time, which works when every string is known in advance and does not when a mod
## adds one or a name runs long.


## Breaks [param text] into lines of at most [param columns] tiles.
##
## Explicit newlines are kept: a caller that has already decided where a line
## ends is obeyed, and only the runs between them are wrapped.

##
## `Paragraph` clears the box and starts again at the top line, so its page
## begins empty. `_ContText` scrolls by one line and writes at the bottom, so
## its page begins with the line that was underneath: with a two-line box that
## is the previous page's second line, and dropping it loses a line out of every
## paragraph that runs past two.

## cleared and which waits for a press first; `scroll` for `_ContText`, which
## waits and then runs `TextScroll` twice; and `scroll_nowait` for
## `_ContTextNoPause`, the same two scrolls with nothing waited for. The first
## page is `start`. `carried` is how many of the page's first lines the scroll
## moved up rather than printed, since `TextScroll` copies tiles and a carried
