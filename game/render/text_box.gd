## A bordered text window, drawn the way the hardware draws one.
##
## Everything is on the tile grid, at the games' own measurements rather than by
## choice: the border is six tiles of the chosen frame printed as box-drawing
## characters, the interior is white, and text sits one tile in from the left on
## every second row, since a line is eight pixels tall in a box whose rows are
## sixteen apart.
##
## The box composes into one index buffer and goes through the same
## index-plus-palette path a sprite does, so a glyph and a Pokémon are lit by the
## same code. Only indices 0 and 3 appear: 1bpp graphics have no middle colours.
##
## Text reveals a tile at a time and waits at the end of each page.
## [method advance] and [method finish] are plain methods as well as key
## handlers, so a screen can be photographed mid-sentence.

## Emitted when the last page has been shown and advanced past.

## `LoadBlinkingCursor` writes '▼' at screen tile (18, 17) and
## `UnloadBlinkingCursor` puts the '─' of the border back. The box's own top
## row is 12, so that is column 18 of its bottom row, and the arrow is what
## every wait for a button looks like: `Paragraph`, `_ContText` and
## `PromptText` all load it before `PromptButton` and unload it after.
const CURSOR_CODE: int = 0xEE
const CURSOR_COLUMN: int = 18
## `PromptButton.blink_cursor` reads `hVBlankCounter` and `and 1 << 4`, so the
## arrow is up for sixteen frames and the border's own '─' is back for the
