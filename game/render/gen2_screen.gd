class_name Gen2Screen
extends Control

## A Game Boy Color screen: 160x144 pixels, scaled by a whole number to fit.
##
## What the game draws goes into a hardware-sized [SubViewport] blown up by an
## integer factor, since any other scale resamples an 8x8 tile into something
## that crawls when it moves. Surrounding chrome is ordinary Godot UI at window
## resolution, which is why this is a [Control] and not a stretch setting.
##
## [method display_native] is a second layer behind it, covering the same
## rectangle at window resolution, for a view that cannot be drawn into a 160x144
## buffer and magnified but still has to line up with the boxes above it.
##
## [member expanded] widens the buffer instead of framing it. The window is not
## 10:9 and never was; the black bars are the shape of a screen this project can
## draw past, so a view that asks for it is given a surface the size of the whole
## control and fills it with more world. Interface is unmoved: [method display]
## puts a screen inside a 160x144 rectangle centred in that surface, so every
## box, menu and cursor is laid out exactly where the cartridge laid it out and
## only the surround grows. [member zoom_step] is how many whole pixels a
## hardware pixel is drawn as, counted from the largest that fits.

const WIDTH: int = 160
const HEIGHT: int = 144
## Below one screen pixel per hardware pixel the picture is halved rather than
## stepped, which is what puts a whole region in a window.
const MIN_SCALE: float = 0.25
## An expanded buffer grows by whole map blocks, so half the difference from the
## hardware screen is always a whole tile and the interface rectangle inside it
## lands on the grid every screen is laid out against.
const BUFFER_STEP: int = 32
## How far past the fitting scale a player may zoom out. Three steps reaches
## MIN_SCALE from a 1x window, and the same three from any other.
