class_name Gen2GameFrame
extends Control

## Places the hardware screen and the on-screen controller, in either orientation
## and at any window size. Portrait sends the screen to the top and gives the
## controller the room under it, the only arrangement where a thumb is not over
## the map; landscape centres the screen and leaves the margins either side, where
## the thumbs already are. With no controller on screen both cases centre in the
## whole frame. The frame also owns the way back from hidden controls, watched
## here rather than in [Gen2TouchPad] because a hidden pad is exactly when it is
## needed and it has to be reachable from anywhere on the game screen.

## How much of a portrait screen the controller may take. The hardware screen is
## 10:9, so even a tall phone has this much left over once the map has its share.
