extends RefCounted

## `AnimateFrontpic`, the wobble a front pic does when it is sent out, looked at
## in a menu, traded, evolved or hatched. The cartridge's shape is a per-frame
## interpreter over two nested state machines and so is this one, because a
## `dorepeat` counter and a `SetWait` are read while the animation runs. What it
## produces is a 7x7 box of tile numbers, which is what `PokeAnim_PlaceGraphic`
## writes into `wTilemap`; the caller stamps that box and nothing here draws.
## Crystal only: pokegold ships no `pic_animation.asm`, so a record this has none
## of animates nothing and the caller plays the cry on its own.

## `AnimateFrontpic`'s loop has no `DelayFrame` of its own: the frame comes from
## `HDMATransferTilemapToWRAMBank3`, whose `WaitDMATransfer` is a `DelayFrame`
## loop. So a scene command that transfers again costs that again.
## `PokeAnim_SetVBank1` ends `Setup`, `Setup2` and `Idle` with one attrmap
## transfer; `PokeAnim_DeinitFrames` is a tilemap and an attrmap transfer, which
## is what `BasePic` and `Finish` are made of.
