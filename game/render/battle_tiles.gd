extends RefCounted

## The battle screen's tile page, assembled the way the hardware assembles it. A
## battle loads four sheets into one run of tile numbers, overlapping on purpose:
## the battle font goes in first and the two HUD borders over the middle of it, so
## thirteen of its tiles are never seen. This copies them in the same order into
## one strip and keeps the cartridge's tile numbers, so the constants below are
## the disassembly's own. Node-free like the rest of the drawing layer.

const TILE: int = Gen2Font.TILE

## The first and last tile numbers a battle's page covers.
const FIRST_TILE: int = 0x55
const LAST_TILE: int = 0x78

## `StatsScreen_LoadFont` reaches further down: `LoadStatsScreenPageTilesGFX`
## parks seventeen tiles at $31, so the stats screen and the move screen assemble
## the same strip starting there.

const STATS_TILES_AT: int = RomLayout.STATS_FIRST_TILE

## The page indicator squares `StatsScreen_LoadPageIndicators` writes as 2x2
## blocks: the small one for a page that is not open and the large one for the
## one that is.
const PAGE_SQUARE_SMALL: int = 0x36
const PAGE_SQUARE_LARGE: int = 0x3A
## `'⁂'`, the shiny marker, at this sheet's own charmap code.
const SHINY: int = 0x3F
## The vertical divider both `StatsScreen_PlaceVerticalDivider` and each page
## draw, and the two exp bar end caps the pink page closes its bar with.

const HP_LABEL: int = 0x60
## The nine fill levels, from empty to eight pixels lit.
const HP_BAR_EMPTY: int = 0x62
const HP_BAR_FULL: int = 0x6A
## The cap that closes a bar. The player's HUD uses the tile after it, which is
## the same shape hanging off the other side.
const HP_BAR_END: int = 0x6B
## The seven partial fills of the exp bar. Its empty and full tiles are the HP
## bar's own: only the middle of it is drawn from a sheet of its own.
const EXP_BAR_FIRST_PARTIAL: int = 0x55

## The level symbol, printed before a number.
const LEVEL: int = 0x6E

## The enemy's HUD hangs from a side on its left; the player's from one on its
## right. Both close with a bottom edge and two corners.

## border is scattered rather than copied whole (`HPExpBarBorderGFX` tile 0 to
