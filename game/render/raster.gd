## A background scrolled by a different amount on each scanline, which is what the
## hardware's `SCX` is once a routine rewrites it part way down a frame. The
## background map is wider than the screen, [param map_width] against the image's
## own width, and everything past what was drawn is blank, so an offset wraps
## rather than leaving a gap. An offset is a distance to look *right* into the
## map, so a larger one puts the drawn content further left. Node-free and pure,
## which is what lets a scroll be asserted headless rather than photographed.

## Rows sharing an offset are moved together, since a run of scanlines with one
## value is the shape every routine that does this produces: three bands for
## `BattleIntroSlidingPics`, one for a whole-screen scroll.

## The same thing vertically, which is what `hLYOverride*` pointed at `rSCY`
## produces: each scanline reads its own row of the map.

## The map is [param map_height] tall against the image's own height and
## everything past what was drawn is blank, exactly as [method scroll]'s columns
## are, so a row that wraps past the drawn image comes back blank.
