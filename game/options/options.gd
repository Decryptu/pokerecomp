## Player options, in two independent blocks.
##
## The cartridge block is the real `wOptions` .. `wOptionsEnd` bytes, so the
## in-game OPTION menu and this launcher screen can never disagree about what a
## setting means. The app block is everything the hardware had no concept of.
##
## `data/default_options.asm` is byte identical between the two pins, so nothing
## here is profile split.
