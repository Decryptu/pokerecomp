## Which behaviour a run is played under, where this project and the cartridge
## disagree on purpose.
##
## Separate from [Gen2Options], which is the installation's own settings: a rule
## changes what the engine DOES, so it belongs to the run that produced a save
## rather than to whichever machine is playing it. A divergence becomes a named
## flag here one at a time, each with a live branch on both sides and a test on
## each.
##
## Every flag is named for the cartridge's behaviour and answers "reproduce the
## hardware", so a flag that is off is this project's own corrected answer. That
## way a flag added later cannot silently change what an existing run did: the
## default for a new flag is whatever [constant MODE_CURRENT] says, which is the
## behaviour that shipped before the flag existed.

## Every named flag, mapped to what [constant MODE_CURRENT] does today. The
## descriptions belong beside the branch, not here; each key names the
## `docs/bugs_and_glitches.md` entry it switches.
const FLAGS: Dictionary = {
	## `BattleCommand_BellyDrum` calls `BattleCommand_AttackUp2` BEFORE the HP
	## check, so a failed Belly Drum has already raised Attack by two stages.
	&"belly_drum_boosts_below_half_hp": false,
	## `CalcExpAtLevel` runs its formula at level 1, where the medium slow curve's
	## `- 140` underflows three bytes.
	&"medium_slow_level_one_underflow": false,
	## `AI_Cautious`'s `ret nc` abandons the remaining move slots on a failed
	## roll rather than moving on to the next one.
	&"cautious_ai_abandons_remaining_moves": false,
	## `ShortHPBar_CalcPixelFrame`'s off-by-one, which changes the HP NUMBER
	## printed mid-drain under a 48-pixel maximum and never the bar.
	&"short_hp_bar_number_off_by_one": false,

## What each flag is, for a player choosing one. Keyed like [constant FLAGS] and
## in its order: `title` names the bug and `detail` says what the CARTRIDGE does,
## which is what the flag reproduces when it is on. Said without a source symbol,
## because the symbols are beside the branches; this is the only wording a
## settings screen has, so a second copy in the launcher would go stale.

## The mutual recoil faint is deliberately NOT a flag: the award pass

## becomes a flag when turn-event ordering makes the difference visible, and a
## flag with both sides identical would be scaffolding.

## default; `vanilla` reproduces every listed bug; `qol` corrects every one.
