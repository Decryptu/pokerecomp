## The exp bar filling, one pixel at a time (`AnimateExpBar`). Not the HP bar
## again: `.LoopLevels` fills to the end, raises the level and refills from empty,
## so this is a list of segments, one per level crossed plus `.FinishExpBar`'s
## partial fill. Its text ordering is the opposite of the HP bar's:
## `Text_MonGainedExpPoint` is printed before `AnimateExpBar` and
## `BattleText_StringBuffer1GrewToLevel` inside the loop. The three guards Gold
## and Silver lack are unreachable from a gain, so nothing here is profile split.

## `EXP_BAR_LENGTH * TILE_WIDTH`: `CalcExpBar` returns `$40 - b` over eight
## tiles.
const LENGTH_PX: int = Gen2BattleHud.EXP_BAR_TILES * Gen2BattleHud.TILE

## `.PlayExpBarSound`'s `ld c, 10`, spent before each segment moves. Its own
## `SFX_EXP_BAR` is played by the screen, which owns the audio player.
const LEAD_FRAMES: int = 10

## `.LoopBarAnimation`'s `ld d, 3` and its floor: 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 and on at a
## frame a pixel. The load is inside the routine, so every segment starts slow.

## answers a pixel high wherever the division is inexact, which is most values.
