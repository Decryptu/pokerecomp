## The six growth curves, what a defeated Pokémon is worth, and the stat
## experience it leaves. Static like [Gen2Stats] and [Gen2Damage]: hardware
## order, every division truncating. The curves are `CalcExpAtLevel`'s formula
## pinned against `data/growth_rates.asm` and swept over all 251 species on all
## three games; see `tools/dump_tables.gd`'s `growth` view.

## `wBaseGrowthRate` order. Only four are used by a real species.
