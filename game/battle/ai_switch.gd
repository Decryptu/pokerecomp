## Whether a trainer pulls its Pokémon out, and which one it sends instead.
##
## `CheckAbleToSwitch` and its five party scans in
## [code]engine/battle/ai/switch.asm[/code], plus the three frequency gates in
## [code]engine/battle/ai/items.asm[/code] that decide how often the answer is
## acted on.
##
## The cartridge works in six-bit masks over the enemy party and reuses one
## variable as both a score and a party index. Here the masks are arrays of party
## indices and the two uses are separate return values, which changes nothing:
## every scan keeps party order, and every place the cartridge converts a mask to
## an index it takes the lowest index set, which is what every scan here answers
## with too.

## `BASE_AI_SWITCH_SCORE`, where [method matchup_score] starts before anything
## nudges it.
const BASE_SCORE: int = 10

## The score at or above which `CheckAbleToSwitch` stops looking: things are
## going well enough that there is nothing to think about.
const COMFORTABLE_SCORE: int = 11

## The three tiers `wEnemySwitchMonParam`'s high nibble carries, in rising order
## of how much the AI wants out. The low nibble is the party index, which is why
## the cartridge adds them together.

const TIER_MID: int = 2
const TIER_HIGH: int = 3

## How often each frequency acts on each tier, out of 256. Read off
## `SwitchOften`, `SwitchRarely` and `SwitchSometimes`, whose `$30` branches are
## written inverted ("don't switch if the roll is under") and are stated here as
## the chance of switching, which is what they come to.

## against a tenths figure, so anything above ten counts.
