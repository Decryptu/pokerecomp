class_name Gen2HpBarAnimation
extends RefCounted

## The HP bar draining or filling, one pixel at a time
## (engine/battle/anim_hp_bar.asm). The bar arrives before the message that
## describes the hit, which is the source's order rather than a choice: `NormalHit`
## runs `applydamage` before `criticaltext`. `_AnimateHPBar` has two branches, keyed
## on whether the maximum is at least `HP_BAR_LENGTH_PX`; both redraw exactly one
## pixel per iteration, so both are one pixel per step here, and what differs is
## only the HP number printed beside the bar, which [method hp] answers.

## `HP_BAR_LENGTH * TILE_WIDTH`, the bar's full width in pixels.
const LENGTH_PX: int = Gen2BattleHud.HP_BAR_TILES * Gen2BattleHud.TILE

## `HPBarAnim_BGMapUpdate` waits two frames per redraw, on both the DMG path and
## the CGB one: a battle bar is `wWhichHPBar` 0 or 1, which takes `.load_0` or
## `.load_1` into `.finish`'s two `DelayFrame`s.

## Mid-animation this is the inverse of `ComputeHPBarPixels`, which is what the
## long branch prints as it steps real HP toward the target. The short branch is
## `ShortHPBar_CalcPixelFrame`'s own answer instead, whose off-by-one for low HP
## is switched by `short_hp_bar_number_off_by_one`. Only the number differs,
## never the bar.

## `ShortHPBar_CalcPixelFrame`, which is how a maximum under the bar's own width
## recovers an HP number from a pixel count. Its loop subtracts before it tests,
## so an exact multiple of the width is counted and then rounded up again: one HP
## too many, which is `docs/bugs_and_glitches.md`'s low-HP off-by-one. pret's fix
## stops the loop on the zero. The answer is clamped to the two ends of this
## animation, the routine's own `wCurHPAnimLowHP`/`wCurHPAnimHighHP` comparison,
## which is why the extra HP is invisible until the drain passes through a multiple.
