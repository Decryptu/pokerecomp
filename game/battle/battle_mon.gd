## One Pokémon as a battle sees it: its stats, what it knows, how much is left
## and how far its stats have been pushed around. Scene-free, reading cartridge
## content through [GameData] and never a ROM.
##
## Stats are worked out at build time, which is when the cartridge works them
## out, and only a level up recalculates them. Stages are applied on the way out
## to the unmodified stat every time, hence stored separately.

## What a Pokémon can carry into a battle, which is the same four slots
## [Gen2Learnset] fills.

## The stats a stage can be applied to, in the order the cartridge keeps them.
const STAGED_STATS: Array = ["attack", "defense", "speed", "sp_attack", "sp_defense"]

## Accuracy and evasion are staged like a stat and are not stats: they have their
## own multiplier table, and there is no number behind them for a stage to
## multiply. They are kept in the same place because a battle raises and lowers
## all seven the same way. See [Gen2Accuracy].
const STAGED_ODDS: Array = ["accuracy", "evasion"]

## Every DV at its maximum. A caller that has not said otherwise gets a Pokémon
## that is as good as its species allows, which is the useful default for a test
## and for a screen with nothing behind it yet. A wild encounter rolls its own;
## see [method random_dvs].

## rather than with them.

## `wPlayerSubstituteHP`: what the doll in front of this Pokémon has left. Read

## both in [method reset_volatile] matches a cartridge that clears the flag and
## leaves the byte, the way [member perish_count] already does.
var substitute_hp: int = 0

## `wPlayerTurnsTaken`: how many turns this Pokémon has actually acted on since
## it came out. `BattleCommand_DoTurn` is the one place it rises, behind the same
## charging check that decides whether PP is spent, so a two-turn release does
## not count twice and Struggle does count. Zeroed on a switch, which is what
## makes "the first turn of this Pokémon" a question the AI can ask.
var turns_taken: int = 0

## The move this Pokémon last used, by move number, or zero for none: what
## Disable and Encore both search a target's own move list for. The cartridge's

## does, since a freshly sent-out Pokémon has not used a move yet.

## `wPlayerFuryCutterCount`: how many times in a row Fury Cutter has connected.
## Zeroed on a switch, by a miss (`ResetFuryCutterCount`) and by choosing any
## other move, which is `ParsePlayerAction`'s own `cp EFFECT_FURY_CUTTER`:
## see [method Gen2Battle._reset_action_counters].
var fury_cutter_count: int = 0

## `wPlayerProtectCount`: how many times in a row this Pokémon has used Protect,
## Detect or Endure. `ProtectChance` halves the odds once per count and refuses
## outright at eight, and the same counter serves all three moves, so alternating
## Protect and Endure does not reset it.
var protect_count: int = 0

## Bide reuses the rollout-count byte on the cartridge, but is separate here so
## the two effects cannot corrupt each other. Damage is the saturating
## `w*DamageTaken` word accumulated while the flag is set.
var bide_turns: int = 0
var bide_damage: int = 0

## Rage's zero-based damage multiplier counter. A hit received while Rage is
## active increments it up to $ff; the next Rage hit deals counter + 1 times
## its calculated damage.
var rage_count: int = 0

## `wPlayerMinimized`: whether this Pokémon has used Minimize since it came out,
## which is the whole of what Stomp's doubled damage reads. Set by
## `MinimizeDropSub` off the move being animated rather than off an effect byte,
## since Minimize carries the ordinary `EFFECT_EVASION_UP`. Zeroed on a switch.
var minimized: bool = false

## `wBattleMonHappiness`: what Return and Frustration read for their power, and
## the one field here that is party data rather than battle state, so a switch
## leaves it alone. `LoadEnemyMon.Happiness` writes [constant BASE_HAPPINESS]
## into `wEnemyMonHappiness` for every wild and trainer Pokémon, which is why
## that is the default rather than zero.

## constants/pokemon_data_constants.asm's CAUGHT_LOCATION_MASK, the low seven
