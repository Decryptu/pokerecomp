extends RefCounted

## Scores an enemy trainer's move choice the way the cartridge's own AI does.
##
## Every slot starts at 20, or 80 with no PP. Each bit set in the trainer class's
## [constant RomLayout.ATTR_AI_MOVE_WEIGHTS] word runs one scoring layer over the
## four slots in the cartridge's bit order ([constant RomLayout.AI_BASIC] through
## [constant RomLayout.AI_RISKY]), nudging scores up (discourage) or down
## (encourage). Lowest score wins, ties broken at random.
##
## [RefCounted], scene-free, randomness injected, so a whole decision can be
## asserted on in a test.
##
## `engine/battle/ai/scoring.asm` finds that minimum by decrementing every slot's
## counter per pass until one reaches zero, then walking backward to give tied
## slots the same outcome. That is an argmin without a MIN instruction, not a
## rule of its own, so [method choose_slot] takes the minimum directly.
##
## Percent chances use the cartridge's `X * 255 / 100` macro rather than the odd
## byte a few call sites adjust by one; the difference is one part in 256.
##
## Not every AI flag or per-move handler exists yet.

## A move nobody can use, whatever the layers think of it.

## The status conditions [constant RomLayout.AI_BASIC] will not stack a second
## of onto a target that already carries one, because the cartridge's own
## status byte refuses a second status the same way [Gen2Status] does.

## [constant RomLayout.AI_RISKY] treats these two as a special case: a move

## Picks a move slot for [param attacker] to use against [param defender], the

##
## [param attacker_turns_taken] and [param defender_turns_taken] are
## `wEnemyTurnsTaken` and `wPlayerTurnsTaken`, each side's own
## [member Gen2BattleMon.turns_taken] read before the turn is spent, which is
## when the cartridge's AI reads them too. Every handler that wants them wants
## the same thing: whether this is the Pokémon's first turn out.

## [member Gen2Battle.screens] for each side. [param attacker_screens] is the
## AI's own, which is the `wEnemyScreens` every `AI_Redundant` screen row reads;
## [param defender_screens] is the player's, which is what its Confuse row and
## its damage estimate read.
##
## [param has_bench] and [param matchup_score] are the two routines the smart
## layer farcalls out of a handler rather than reads off a battler:
## `FindAliveEnemyMons`, which is whether the AI has anybody left to send, and
## `CheckPlayerMoveTypeMatchups`, which is `wEnemyAISwitchScore` and is
## [method Gen2AISwitch.matchup_score] here. Both are supplied the way
## [param weather] is, since this routine scores a pairing rather than a battle;
## the defaults are the neutral states, a lone Pokémon and an unnudged score.
##
## Always returns a slot in range: [method Gen2Battle.move_for] turns an
## unusable slot into Struggle, so no empty-moveset case is needed here.
