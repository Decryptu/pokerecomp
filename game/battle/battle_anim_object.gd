extends RefCounted

## One animation object: a `battle_anim_struct` and the two routines that read it
## (engine/battle_anims/core.asm, helpers.asm). `anim_obj` names a row of
## `BattleAnimObjects`, which supplies the frameset, the motion callback, the
## palette and the graphics sheet, and a place to put it.
##
## Every field is a cartridge byte: coordinates wrap at 256, and an object walking
## off one side is that wrap rather than a clamp. `frame` starts at -1 because
## `GetBattleAnimFrame` increments before it reads.

## Byte positions inside the struct, as `battleanimobj` orders them. Only the
## six a `BattleAnimObjects` row carries; the rest are runtime state.
