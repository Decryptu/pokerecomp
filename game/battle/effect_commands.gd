extends RefCounted

## The steps a move is made of. A move is a short program rather than a switch
## case: the cartridge keeps a command list per effect and runs it in order. An
## ordinary attack announces, spends the PP, works out damage, rolls the hit,
## applies it and checks for a faint, and every other move is that list with steps
## added, removed or replaced. None of it reaches [Gen2Battle], which only runs a
## list. The names are the cartridge's, so a sequence reads against
## `data/moves/effects.asm` line for line.

## Announces the move. First, because a move that fails still says it was used.
const USED_MOVE_TEXT: StringName = &"usedmovetext"

## Spends the PP.
const DO_TURN: StringName = &"doturn"

## The five steps a hit is worked out in, five commands rather than one because
## effects reach inside the formula between them: Present sets the power between
## [constant DAMAGE_STATS] and [constant DAMAGE_CALC], Triple Kick multiplies
## before [constant STAB], and Fury Cutter and Rollout before
## [constant DAMAGE_VARIATION]. None applies anything or rolls for a hit.

## routine under three gates, behind the spread, for a target above, below or
## small.
const DOUBLE_DAMAGE: StringName = &"doubledamage"

## The four steps that write a power over the move's own, all of them between
## [constant DAMAGE_STATS] and [constant DAMAGE_CALC] where the cartridge writes
## into `wPlayerMoveStruct`. [constant HIDDEN_POWER] writes a type as well and
## runs `damagestats` itself, which is why its list carries no `damagestats` of
## its own.

## False Swipe, which leaves the target on one hit point rather than none.

## `resettypematchup`: the constant-damage moves' immunity check, and why their
## lists carry no `stab`. A fixed number has no effectiveness to announce.

## The effects whose list still has work after a miss, and so are not ended by
## [constant CHECK_HIT]. `BattleCommand_CheckHit` ends nothing on the cartridge:

const CONTINUES_AFTER_MISS: Array[int] = [

## The effects `BattleCommand_FailureText`'s `.multihit` names, and the whole of

## doll in front of the same `checkhit` and are not named, so a miss leaves both

const DRAINING_EFFECTS: Array[int] = [
	Gen2MoveEffect.LEECH_HIT, Gen2MoveEffect.DREAM_EATER,
]

## The three moves `BattleCommand_CheckHit`'s `.LockOn` names by number: a

## named and unreachable in both, `OHKOHit` carrying no `checkhit`.
const LOCK_ON_GROUND_MOVES: Array[int] = [
	Gen2MoveEffect.EARTHQUAKE_MOVE, Gen2MoveEffect.FISSURE_MOVE,

## Counter and Mirror Coat do not roll their own accuracy. They validate the
## move that just hit the user, then leave the doubled damage for APPLY_DAMAGE.
const COUNTER: StringName = &"counter"
const MIRROR_COAT: StringName = &"mirrorcoat"

## Selfdestruct and Explosion faint their user after the hit check, miss or
## immunity included. The damage step runs first, halving the defender's Defense.
const SELFDESTRUCT: StringName = &"selfdestruct"

## Takes the damage off, and reports what was actually taken.
const APPLY_DAMAGE: StringName = &"applydamage"

## Takes a quarter of what was dealt off the attacker.
const RECOIL: StringName = &"recoil"

## Reports whoever is down. Both can be, since recoil can take the attacker with
## the defender.
const CHECK_FAINT: StringName = &"checkfaint"

## The end of the list. It does nothing except be the end, which is worth having
## as a step so a sequence reads the way the cartridge's does.
const END_MOVE: StringName = &"endmove"

## Whether the move happens at all: sleep, freeze and paralysis in that order. Not
## part of any sequence, the cartridge running it before the effect is looked up.
const CHECK_STATUS: StringName = &"checkstatus"

## Whether a secondary effect happens, out of the move's own chance: the damage
## lands either way and only what is behind this is decided.
const EFFECT_CHANCE: StringName = &"effectchance"

## The five things a move can leave on a Pokémon, each refusing a target that
## already carries one: the status byte holds one at a time.
const SLEEP_TARGET: StringName = &"sleeptarget"
const POISON_TARGET: StringName = &"poisontarget"
const BURN_TARGET: StringName = &"burntarget"
const FREEZE_TARGET: StringName = &"freezetarget"

## What Toxic leaves behind: [constant POISON_TARGET]'s flag plus the ramping
## counter, which has to start before the first residual turn sees it.
const TOXIC_TARGET: StringName = &"toxictarget"

## The two things a move can leave on [Gen2Substatus] rather than the status
## byte. Flinch is only ever a secondary effect, obeying
## [member Gen2Turn.failed_chance] like the five above; confusion comes both ways,
## as its own status move (Confuse Ray, Supersonic) and as a secondary effect
## (Confusion, Psybeam), so [Gen2MoveEffect] reaches for it from both shapes.
const FLINCH_TARGET: StringName = &"flinchtarget"
const CONFUSE_TARGET: StringName = &"confusetarget"

## Heals the attacker for half of the damage taken: the Absorb family, and
## Dream Eater behind its own rule inside [constant CHECK_HIT].
const DRAIN_TARGET: StringName = &"draintarget"

## Overwrites what [constant DAMAGE_CALC] worked out with the number
## [constant Gen2MoveEffect.SUPER_FANG], [constant Gen2MoveEffect.STATIC_DAMAGE],
## [constant Gen2MoveEffect.LEVEL_DAMAGE] and [constant Gen2MoveEffect.PSYWAVE]
## actually deal. [constant DAMAGE_CALC]'s own roll still ran first, and its
## immunity answer is the one thing about it this keeps.
const FIXED_DAMAGE: StringName = &"fixeddamage"

## Guillotine, Horn Drill and Fissure's own accuracy rule and their own damage:
## nothing here is [constant CHECK_HIT] or [constant APPLY_DAMAGE].
const OHKO: StringName = &"ohko"

## Recharge: locks the user out of its next turn, the tail of Hyper Beam's own
## list rather than anything a target-facing command touches.
const RECHARGE: StringName = &"recharge"

## `BattleCommand_CheckCharge`, the first command of every two-turn list: on the
## release turn it clears the lock and skips over [constant CHARGE], so the rest
## of the list runs as an ordinary attack, which [method Gen2Battle.move_for]
## makes the user's only option. On the charging turn it does nothing and the
## list falls into `doturn` and [constant CHARGE].
const CHARGE_MOVE: StringName = &"chargemove"

## `BattleCommand_Charge`: the charging turn's own line, and the end of the move.
## It stands behind `doturn` and in front of `usedmovetext`, so a charging turn
## announces "made a whirlwind!" and never "used RAZOR WIND!"; Skull Bash is the
## one that carries on, skipping to [constant END_TURN] for the Defense raise
## behind it.
const CHARGE: StringName = &"charge"

## `endturn_command`, which ends the read cycle the way [constant END_MOVE] does.
## Only Skull Bash's list carries one, as the marker `charge` skips forward to.
const END_TURN: StringName = &"endturn"

## `BattleCommand_StartLoop` and `BattleCommand_EndLoop`: a multi-hit move is the
## commands between them run again, `endloop` deciding the count on its first
## pass and rewinding to [constant CRITICAL] until it runs out.
const START_LOOP: StringName = &"startloop"
const END_LOOP: StringName = &"endloop"

## Rollout checks for a live chain, applies its power and advances the hit count;
## the first command resets a finished chain before PP and damage.
const ROLLOUT_CHECK: StringName = &"rolloutcheck"
const ROLLOUT_POWER: StringName = &"rolloutpower"

## `BattleCommand_CheckRampage`, the first command of Thrash, Petal Dance and
## Outrage: it counts a live rampage down and, on the turn it runs out, clears
## the lock and confuses the user unless its own Safeguard refuses.
const CHECK_RAMPAGE: StringName = &"checkrampage"

## Starts Thrash, Petal Dance and Outrage, and marks Defense Curl's persistent
## substatus for Rollout.
const RAMPAGE: StringName = &"rampage"
const CURL: StringName = &"curl"

## Clears every stage on both sides. Only the stages: nothing here touches
## either Pokémon's status byte or [Gen2Substatus].
const HAZE: StringName = &"haze"

## Half the user's maximum HP for an Attack straight to the top of its range.
## Fails free if it has no more than half, or if Attack is already there.
const BELLY_DRUM: StringName = &"bellydrum"
## What one `BattleCommand_AttackUp2` is worth, which is what Belly Drum spends
## before it checks whether it can pay. See [method _belly_drum].
const ATTACK_UP_2_STAGES: int = 2

## Copies the target's stages onto the user, all seven at once. Fails if the
## target has nothing raised or lowered to copy.
const PSYCH_UP: StringName = &"psychup"

## Locks the target's last-used slot for a few turns. Fails against a target that
## has not moved, a Struggle, an empty slot, or one already disabled.
const DISABLE: StringName = &"disable"

## Locks the target into repeating its last move for a few turns.
## [constant DISABLE]'s exclusions apply, plus the two the cartridge names
## outright: neither Encore itself nor Mirror Move means anything repeated.
const ENCORE: StringName = &"encore"

## Puts the target in love, given opposite known genders and no love already, and
## [constant Gen2EffectCommands.CHECK_STATUS] rolls each turn what it costs.
const ATTRACT: StringName = &"attract"

## Shields the user from the opponent's stat-lowering moves until a switch: a drop
## aimed at the user, never a rise. A second use fails without re-applying.
const MIST: StringName = &"mist"

## Raises the user's own critical-hit rate for the rest of the battle, until a
## switch. Fails, without re-applying, on a second use.
const FOCUS_ENERGY: StringName = &"focusenergy"

## Binds the target for a rolled number of turns: it can neither run nor be
## recalled, and loses a sixteenth of its health at the end of each of them.
## Nothing here stops it moving, which is the Generation 2 rule. A target that is
## already bound is left alone without a failure message, since
## `BattleCommand_TrapTarget` simply returns.
const TRAP_TARGET: StringName = &"traptarget"

## Mean Look and Spider Web: the target can neither run nor be recalled, with no
## counter and no damage behind it. The flag goes on the user, which is what
## [constant Gen2Substatus.CANT_RUN] documents.
const ARENA_TRAP: StringName = &"arenatrap"

## The three moves that change the sky, each for [constant Gen2Weather.TURNS].
## Only Sandstorm refuses its own weather; the other two restart their count.
const START_RAIN: StringName = &"startrain"
const START_SUN: StringName = &"startsun"
const START_SANDSTORM: StringName = &"startsandstorm"

## `BattleCommand_Screen`, Light Screen and Reflect both, reading the effect byte
## for which bit to set. A second use fails without restarting the count.
const SCREEN: StringName = &"screen"

## `BattleCommand_Safeguard`, the same shape a side at a time: sets the flag for
## [constant Gen2Screens.TURNS] and fails on a second use.
const SAFEGUARD: StringName = &"safeguard"

## `BattleCommand_PerishSong`: the song both sides hear, whoever sang it. Fails
## only when both are already counting down.
const PERISH_SONG: StringName = &"perishsong"

## A doll in front of the user, the three residuals `ResidualDamage` charges, the
## hazard `SpikesDamage` charges, and the command that clears them.
const SUBSTITUTE: StringName = &"substitute"
const LEECH_SEED: StringName = &"leechseed"
const NIGHTMARE: StringName = &"nightmare"
const CURSE: StringName = &"curse"
const SPIKES: StringName = &"spikes"
const CLEAR_HAZARDS: StringName = &"clearhazards"

## Protect, Endure and Destiny Bond, the first two one routine and one counter:
## `BattleCommand_Endure` is `call ProtectChance / ret c` and a different flag.
const PROTECT: StringName = &"protect"
const ENDURE: StringName = &"endure"
const DESTINY_BOND: StringName = &"destinybond"

## Whirlwind and Roar, which switch the side opposite whoever used them.
const FORCE_SWITCH: StringName = &"forceswitch"

## Baton Pass, which switches the side that used it and hands everything over.
const BATON_PASS: StringName = &"batonpass"

const TELEPORT: StringName = &"teleport"

## Foresight and Lock On, the two flags one side leaves on the other for the
## accuracy step: Foresight's lasts until a switch, Lock On's until the next hit
## check.
const FORESIGHT: StringName = &"foresight"
const LOCK_ON: StringName = &"lockon"

const SPITE: StringName = &"spite"

const PAIN_SPLIT: StringName = &"painsplit"

const THIEF: StringName = &"thief"

const PURSUIT: StringName = &"pursuit"

## Beat Up: one pass of its loop, and the line behind the loop that says nothing
## unless every member was refused.
const BEAT_UP: StringName = &"beatup"
const BEAT_UP_FAIL_TEXT: StringName = &"beatupfailtext"

## `BattleCommand_CheckSafeguard`, Safeguard's loud half: the four status moves
## carrying it end on `SafeguardProtectText`, while the six secondary effects
## reach `SafeCheckSafeguard` and are refused silently.
const CHECK_SAFEGUARD: StringName = &"checksafeguard"

## Recover, Softboiled, Milk Drink and Rest, and separately the three heals that
## read the clock. Both refuse at full HP, and both spend the turn doing it.
const HEAL: StringName = &"heal"
const TIMED_HEAL: StringName = &"timedheal"

## Thunder's own accuracy, replacing the move's byte for the turn: half in sun,
## certain in rain, which [constant CHECK_HIT]'s always-hits branch already does.
const THUNDER_ACCURACY: StringName = &"thunderaccuracy"

## King's Rock, at the tail of every ordinary attack's list: the item's own
## parameter and not a secondary effect, since no [constant EFFECT_CHANCE] gates
## it.
const KINGS_ROCK: StringName = &"kingsrock"

## Solarbeam in sun: `BattleCommand_SkipSunCharge` skips the charge as
## `checkcharge` does on a release turn, so the beam fires the turn it is chosen.
const SKIP_SUN_CHARGE: StringName = &"skipsuncharge"

## The move's own animation, and the damage flash `BattleAnimRunScript` chains off
## `wBattleAfterAnim`. `BattleCommand_MoveAnim` is `lowersub`, `moveanimnosub`,
## `raisesub`, so this is all three; 35 lists carry the subs on their own.
const MOVE_ANIM: StringName = &"moveanim"
const MOVE_ANIM_NO_SUB: StringName = &"moveanimnosub"

## The substitute's doll dropped out of the way of an animation and put back
## after it. Both answer nothing when the user has no doll up.
const LOWER_SUB: StringName = &"lowersub"
const RAISE_SUB: StringName = &"raisesub"

## The same two pictures with no animation. Only Minimize and Double Team's list
## carries one: `lowersubnoanim` sits between the raise animation and `raisesub`,
## so the doll is off the field for the one command that would draw over it.
const LOWER_SUB_NO_ANIM: StringName = &"lowersubnoanim"

## The five effects `BattleCommand_LowerSub` names, which is every two-turn move:

## The animation a stat move plays, between the change and its message.
## `BattleCommand_StatUpAnim` uses one for both sides; `..._StatDownAnim` picks
## `ANIM_ENEMY_STAT_DOWN` or `ANIM_WOBBLE`. A failed change skips neither:
## `RaiseStat` sets `wFailedMessage` rather than `wAttackMissed`, so a capped stat
## animates and then says it will not go higher.
const STAT_UP_ANIM: StringName = &"statupanim"
const STAT_DOWN_ANIM: StringName = &"statdownanim"

## The four effects `BattleCommand_MoveAnimNoSub` alternates `wBattleAnimParam`
## for rather than clearing it. Triple Kick is the fifth and is not one of them:
## its `.triplekick` label is jumped to over the clear, so a kick keeps the param
## `kickcounter` left and every kick carries the damage flash.
