## Draws the battle field: two pics, two status panels, two HP bars, the exp bar
## and whatever a battle animation is putting over them. It does not own the
## battle; call [method set_battle_data] once, then [method set_view] whenever
## the screen has new display values to show.
##
## The pics are drawn through `wTilemap` rather than placed at a corner, because
## that map is what a battle animation edits: `BattleBGEffect_HideMon` blanks a
## battler's box, `..._RemoveMon` shifts it a column at a time and the pic-resize
## script stamps smaller arrangements of the same tiles over it. The screen owns
## the map and hands it in; a tile id is the hardware's, `$00` up for the enemy's
## front pic and `$31` up for the player's back pic.
##
## Panels compose into one screen-sized index buffer drawn over the pics with
## index 0 transparent: a panel is a shape on a white field, drawn into the
## background layer on hardware, so the pics show through everything that is not
## ink.
##
## Every background layer is part of one plane, so a scroll applies to all of
## them alike: the view hands over a per-scanline offset and each layer is
## scrolled through [Gen2Raster] by the same one. The animation's own objects are
## not part of that plane and do not scroll, the way OAM does not.
