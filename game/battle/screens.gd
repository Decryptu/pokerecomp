## `wPlayerScreens` and `wEnemyScreens`: the flags that belong to a side of the
## field rather than to whoever is standing on it. Nothing clears these on a
## switch, which is the whole difference between them and [Gen2Substatus]: a
## Reflect put up by one Pokemon still halves damage for the one sent out behind
## it. Only the counters ending them do. Pure arithmetic and no state, the same
## shape as [Gen2Weather].

## `constants/battle_constants.asm`'s bit numbers, kept rather than renumbered so
## a `bit SCREENS_REFLECT` in the source reads across. Bit 1 is skipped there and
## SCREENS_UNUSED is exactly what its name says.

## What `BattleCommand_Screen` and `BattleCommand_Safeguard` all write. Each

## [constant Gen2Weather.TURNS] does.

## What a screen does to the defending stat: `sla c` / `rl b` on the sixteen-bit
## value, before the critical-hit check that may discard it.

## and Light Screen on the special one. Answers [constant NONE] for neither.
