class_name Gen2Party
extends RefCounted

## The Pokémon one side of a battle has, and which of them is out.
##
## An ordered list and a cursor into it, not a set: the order is what a switch
## menu shows and what a replacement is chosen from, and the first entry leads. A
## wild battle is a party of one, so it needs no special case.
##
## Fainted Pokémon stay in the list, still counting against the six. A battle is
## lost when all of them are down, not when the list runs out.

## What a trainer can carry. Six is a rule of these games rather than of this
## class, but a party that is longer is a bug somewhere upstream and is worth
## refusing at the door.
