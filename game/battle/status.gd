## One byte as the cartridge stores it: the low three bits are turns of sleep
## left and the four above are one flag each. That is the rule as well as the
## storage, since one status at a time falls out of checking the byte whole.
##
## Sleep, freeze and paralysis are checked before a move; burn and paralysis bend
## a stat where it is read; burn and poison take a slice at the end of the turn.
## The arithmetic behind that, holding no state.

## The low three bits: turns of sleep left, from 1 to 7.
const SLEEP_MASK: int = 0b111

## One flag each, in the cartridge's own bit order.
const POISON: int = 1 << 3
const BURN: int = 1 << 4
const FREEZE: int = 1 << 5
const PARALYSIS: int = 1 << 6

const NONE: int = 0

## Everything the byte can say, which is what [method is_afflicted] asks.
const ANY: int = SLEEP_MASK | POISON | BURN | FREEZE | PARALYSIS

## The cartridge rolls the low three bits until it gets neither 0 nor 7 and adds
## one, so the counter starts here and the Pokémon loses one to six turns.
const MIN_SLEEP: int = 2
const MAX_SLEEP: int = 7

## Rest does not roll: it writes `REST_SLEEP_TURNS + 1` over the whole byte, so
## the sleeper loses two turns and every other status goes with it.
const REST_SLEEP_TURNS: int = 2

## Shifts rather than divisions on the hardware, both floored at one.
const BURN_ATTACK_SHIFT: int = 1
const PARALYSIS_SPEED_SHIFT: int = 2

## Being fully paralysed is a quarter of the time, out of 256.
const PARALYSIS_CHANCE: int = 64
const CHANCE_RANGE: int = 256

## `HandleDefrost`'s own `cp 10 percent`, which is 25 and not 26: the `percent`
## macro (macros/data.asm) is `* $ff / 100`, so ten of them truncate to 25 out of
## 256 rather than to a tenth of the range.
const THAW_CHANCE: int = 25

## Burn and poison cost an eighth of the maximum, never less than one.
const RESIDUAL_DIVISOR: int = 8

## Toxic ramps instead: a sixteenth of the maximum per turn it has been up.
const TOXIC_RESIDUAL_DIVISOR: int = 16
