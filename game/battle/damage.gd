extends RefCounted

## The damage formula, in the order and the arithmetic the hardware uses.
##
## Every step truncates and none of them commute, so this is a sequence rather
## than an expression: the matchup applies one type at a time with a truncation
## between, the critical multiplier lands before the cap and minimum, and the
## spread after everything.
##
## The cartridge's four commands are [method damage_stats], [method damage_calc],
## [method stab_damage] and [method apply_variation], run one at a time by
## [Gen2EffectCommands] because half a dozen effects write between two of them.
## [method calculate_with] is the composition, for a caller with no list to put
## the four in.

## The cap lands before the minimum is added, so the biggest hit is 999 and the
## smallest that connects at all is 2.
const DAMAGE_CAP: int = 997
const MIN_DAMAGE: int = 2

## The spread, out of 255: rerolled under 217, so 85% to 100%.
const MIN_VARIATION: int = 217
const MAX_VARIATION: int = 255

## A critical doubles the damage here rather than recomputing it at a higher
## level the way Generation 1 did.
const CRITICAL_MULTIPLIER: int = 2

## The chance at each critical level, out of 256; level 0 is every hit's.
const CRITICAL_CHANCES: Array = [17, 32, 64, 85, 128, 128, 128]

## Moves with a raised critical rate, worth two critical levels each.
const HIGH_CRITICAL_MOVES: Array = [0x02, 0x0D, 0x4B, 0x98, 0xA3, 0xB1, 0xEE]

## Focus Energy: a state the attacker is in, not a property of the move.
const FOCUS_ENERGY_LEVELS: int = 1

## Exempt from STAB and the type chart: `BattleCommand_Stab` returns first.
const STRUGGLE: int = 0xA5

## STAB is half again, truncated, not a multiply by 1.5.
const STAB_NUMERATOR: int = 3
const STAB_DENOMINATOR: int = 2

## A typeless physical hit against the Pokémon's own stats: no STAB, no matchup
## and never a critical.
const CONFUSION_POWER: int = 40

## `TruncateHL_BC` shifts the pair right by two until both fit in a byte,
## flooring at one: the ratio survives and the magnitude does not.
const STAT_BYTE_MAX: int = 0xFF
const TRUNCATE_SHIFT: int = 4


## A hit with both rolls decided: deterministic, and the whole formula, for a
## caller (the AI, a test) that has no list to put the four steps in. Present,
## Triple Kick, Fury Cutter and Rollout each write between two of them, which is
## why the effect commands call the four rather than this.
##
## Returns { damage, critical, effectiveness, stab, immune }.
## [code]effectiveness[/code] is in tenths and is the announced number, not
## always the one damage used (see [method GameData.type_effectiveness]);
## [code]immune[/code] is a matchup of zero, which is a miss rather than a hit
## for nothing.
##
## Selfdestruct's halved defense comes off the move's own effect byte here, the
## way `BattleCommand_DamageCalc` reads it, so a caller predicting a hit gets the
## same number the hit will deal.
