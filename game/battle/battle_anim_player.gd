extends RefCounted

## One battle animation playing: `RunBattleAnimScript`'s frame loop
## (engine/battle_anims/anim_commands.asm). [Gen2BattleAnimScript] is the
## interpreter and [Gen2BattleAnimObject] is one object; this is what the
## cartridge does with both once a frame, running the script until it yields,
## stepping every live object and collecting what they would put in `wShadowOAM`.
## Scene-free: a frame answers with sprites, a tile window and a palette per
## sprite. [method unimplemented] reports what an animation asked for and did not
## get, which cartridge data no longer produces.

## `NUM_BATTLE_ANIM_STRUCTS`: an eleventh object is simply not spawned.
const MAX_OBJECTS: int = 10

## Matters only because `BattleAnimCmd_ClearObjs` counts bytes, not objects.
const OBJECT_STRUCT_BYTES: int = 24

## `BattleAnimCmd_ClearObjs` clears `$a0` bytes where the ten structs are `$f0`,
## stopping inside the seventh. Zeroing a struct's first byte frees it, so seven
## go and the last three survive a command that reads as clearing everything:
## the cartridge's own bug (docs/bugs_and_glitches.md), reproduced.
const CLEAR_OBJS_BYTES: int = 0xA0

## The hardware's forty sprites. An object whose sprites would overrun aborts the
## whole update, so a busy frame loses the objects after it rather than one.
const MAX_SPRITES: int = 40

## The five sheets `anim_1gfx` through `anim_5gfx` may have loaded at once.
const TILE_DICT_ENTRIES: int = 5

## The window graphics load into, `BATTLEANIM_BASE_TILE` up to `vTiles1`.
## `BattleAnimCmd_*GFX` stops once the running tile id reaches it, so a
## five-sheet animation can silently load fewer.
const MAX_TILES: int = 128 - Gen2BattleAnimObject.BASE_TILE

## `wBattleAnimFlags` bits (constants/ram_constants.asm).
const FLAG_KEEP_SPRITES: int = 1 << 3

## The two `AnimObjGFX` rows with no sheet: the battler graphics commands fill
## them from whichever picture is on the field.
const GFX_PLAYERHEAD: int = 0x28
const GFX_ENEMYFEET: int = 0x29

## `vTiles0`, whose top `BattleAnimCmd_BattlerGFX_*` counts back from.
const OBJECT_TILES: int = 0x80

## Five background effects at once; a sixth is not queued, as an eleventh object
## is not spawned.
const MAX_BG_EFFECTS: int = Gen2BattleAnimBgEffects.MAX_EFFECTS

## What `Rollout_FillLYOverridesBackup` and `.playframe` check `wFXAnimID` for.
const ROLLOUT: int = 0xCD

## `BATTLE_AFTERANIMS` and the four offsets from it written into
## `wBattleAfterAnim`; `BattleAnimRunScript` adds the base back.
const BATTLE_AFTERANIMS: int = 0x10E
const AFTER_ANIM_NONE: int = 0
const AFTER_ANIM_ENEMY_DAMAGE: int = 0x10F - BATTLE_AFTERANIMS

const AFTER_ANIM_PLAYER_DAMAGE: int = 0x112 - BATTLE_AFTERANIMS
const AFTER_ANIM_WOBBLE: int = 0x113 - BATTLE_AFTERANIMS

## The status animations `PlayOpponentBattleAnim` plays on the target, past
## `wFXAnimID`'s low byte and so reached by `BattleAnimRunScript`'s `.not_move`.
## Only these five of the block are named, the rest having no caller: `ANIM_SLP`
## and `ANIM_SAP` sit among them and nothing in either pin asks for one.
const ANIM_CONFUSED: int = 0x103
