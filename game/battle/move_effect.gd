## What each move's effect byte makes it do, as a list of commands: the table the
## cartridge keeps in `data/moves/effects.asm`, to be read against it. Almost every
## list is [constant NORMAL_HIT] with something inserted, which is the reason for
## keeping the shape: burn, paralysis, stat changes and the multi-hit moves are
## commands added to a list rather than branches added to the turn loop.

## The effect bytes with a list of their own, numbered as the cartridge's move
## table numbers them.
##
## Recoil is here because Struggle needs it: without it two empty Pokémon never
## finish their battle. The rest are the status conditions in their two shapes, a
## move whose whole purpose is the status and a move that damages and leaves
## something behind on a roll.
const SLEEP: int = 1
const POISON_HIT: int = 2
## Absorb, Mega Drain, Giga Drain and Leech Life: half the calculated hit healed
## onto the attacker. Named for the disassembly's "LeechHit" label rather than a
## bare "drain", so this reads against `data/moves/effects_pointers.asm` line for
## line.
const LEECH_HIT: int = 3
const BURN_HIT: int = 4
const FREEZE_HIT: int = 5
const PARALYZE_HIT: int = 6
## Dream Eater: [constant LEECH_HIT]'s drain gated on the target being asleep.
## The gate lives inside [method Gen2EffectCommands._check_hit] rather than its
## own command, because that is where the cartridge's shared accuracy check puts
## it: against an awake target it reads as a miss, not a separate failure.

const PARALYZE: int = 67

## The three effects that replace the move being executed and restart the
## effect interpreter. Mirror Move takes the opponent's last move, Metronome
## samples the full move table with its source exclusions, and Sleep Talk

## [member Gen2Turn.called_move_number] and the restart loop in [Gen2Battle].

## Two to five hits, the cartridge's own weighted roll; and exactly two, always,

## Twineedle: the same two hits as [constant DOUBLE_HIT], with a chance of
## poison rolled once before either lands and applied once after both do,
## never per hit.
const TWINEEDLE: int = 77

## Guillotine, Horn Drill and Fissure: an instant faint if it connects at all,
## which is its own accuracy rule rather than the move's stored one. See
## [method Gen2EffectCommands._ohko].
const OHKO: int = 38

## The four effects behind [constant Gen2EffectCommands.FIXED_DAMAGE], sharing
## one command the way the cartridge shares one, `BattleCommand_ConstantDamage`,
## reading the effect byte back to decide which number it is.
## Super Fang: half the target's current HP, floored, never less than one.

## Psywave: a roll of the user's own, [method Gen2Damage.psywave_damage].
const PSYWAVE: int = 88

## The substatuses: flinching and confusion in both shapes, plus Hyper Beam, the
## only move that recharges. Numbers read off the real move table with
## [code]tools/dump_tables.gd[/code]: Rolling Kick, Headbutt, Bite, Bone Club and
## Hyper Fang carry 31; Confusion and Psybeam 76; Supersonic and Confuse Ray 49;

## The two-turn moves: charge on the first turn, hit on the second. Razor Wind,
## Solarbeam, Fly and Dig share the plain shape; Sky Attack and Skull Bash each
## add one thing behind the hit, which is why they keep their own effect byte
## rather than folding into the plain one. Fly and Dig share 155 with each
## other and nothing else, since both leave the field for their charge turn on
## the cartridge. Their shared charge command now carries the two distinct
## semi-invulnerability flags and the incoming hit check reads them.

const DIG_MOVE: int = 91
## The other four moves `BattleCommand_Charge.UsedText` names by number, kept

## Rest, kept here for the same reason Fly and Dig are: four moves share

const REST_MOVE: int = 156

## None of the three needs any state this file has not already grown for
## something else: [Gen2BattleMon.reset_stages] for Haze,
## [method Gen2BattleMon.change_stage] and [method Gen2BattleMon.take_damage]
## for Belly Drum, and reading one side's stages to write the other's for
## Psych Up.

const PSYCH_UP: int = 143

## Disable, Mist, Focus Energy, Attract and Encore, numbered off the real
## cartridge with [code]tools/dump_tables.gd -- gold moves[/code], since Gen II
## does not share Generation 1's numbering. Mist and Focus Energy need nothing
## new; Disable, Attract and Encore are what
## [member Gen2BattleMon.disabled_slot], [member Gen2BattleMon.encored_slot] and
## [method Gen2BattleMon.gender] exist for.
const DISABLE: int = 86
const MIST: int = 46
const FOCUS_ENERGY: int = 47

## The two trapping effects, numbered the same way. Bind, Wrap, Fire Spin, Clamp
## and Whirlpool carry the first; Mean Look and Spider Web the second.
const TRAP_TARGET: int = 42
const MEAN_LOOK: int = 106

## The heal family. [constant HEAL] is Recover, Softboiled, Milk Drink and Rest
## sharing `BattleCommand_Heal`; the other three are one command,
## `BattleCommand_TimeBasedHealContinue`, entered at three different labels that
## differ only in the time of day they ask for.
const HEAL: int = 32
const MORNING_SUN: int = 132
const SYNTHESIS: int = 133

## was a weather one.
const SANDSTORM: int = 115
const RAIN_DANCE: int = 136
const SUNNY_DAY: int = 137
const THUNDER: int = 152

## The three side-of-the-field screens. Light Screen and Reflect share
## `BattleCommand_Screen`, which tells them apart by this byte, so the two are
## one command and two lists that read the same.
const LIGHT_SCREEN: int = 35
const REFLECT: int = 65
const SAFEGUARD: int = 124

## Perish Song, which is neither a screen nor a status: a count on each Pokémon
## on the field that a switch escapes.
const PERISH_SONG: int = 114

## Substitute: a quarter of the user's own health standing in front of it, with
## hit points of its own on [member Gen2BattleMon.substitute_hp]. Eighteen
## commands ask whether one is up and every one of them refuses on a yes.
const SUBSTITUTE: int = 79

## The three residuals `ResidualDamage` charges behind burn and poison, and
## Spikes, which is field state on [member Gen2Battle.screens] instead. Rapid Spin
## is the only move that undoes any of them.
const LEECH_SEED: int = 84
const NIGHTMARE: int = 107
const CURSE: int = 109
const SPIKES: int = 112
const RAPID_SPIN: int = 129

## Protect and Detect are one effect byte under two move numbers, and Endure is
## the byte beside it: `BattleCommand_Endure` is `ProtectChance` and a different
## flag. Both carry priority 3 in `MoveEffectPriorities`, which is why
## [constant Gen2Battle.EFFECT_PRIORITIES] named them before either was written.
const PROTECT: int = 111
const ENDURE: int = 116

## Destiny Bond, which rolls nothing and never fails: the flag goes up and the
## opponent's own `BattleCommand_CheckFaint` reads it.
const DESTINY_BOND: int = 98

## Whirlwind and Roar, which are one effect byte and two endings: against a
## trainer they drag a random party member out, and against a wild they end the
## battle outright. Priority 0, so the user almost always moves second, which the
## command then requires of itself.
const FORCE_SWITCH: int = 28

## Roar's own move number. `.succeed` picks between the two lines by comparing
## the move's animation byte against `ROAR`, and every move here animates as
## itself, so the number is what tells the pair apart.
const ROAR_MOVE: int = 46

## Baton Pass, the one effect whose player half cannot be resolved inside the
## turn that started it.
const BATON_PASS: int = 127

## `EFFECT_NORMAL_HIT` as a byte rather than [constant NORMAL_HIT]'s list:
## `DoSubstituteDamage` stamps it over the move's own once a doll has broken.
const NORMAL_HIT_EFFECT: int = 0

## Beat Up: one hit per standing, healthy member of the user's own party, each
## worked out from that member's base Attack and level rather than the field
## Pokémon's. The one list with no `stab`, so no same-type bonus, no weather and
## no matchup.
const BEAT_UP: int = 154

## Pain Split, which averages the two Pokémon's health rather than moving damage
## across the field.
const PAIN_SPLIT: int = 91

## Lock On and Mind Reader, one byte: a flag on the *target* that makes the
## aimer's next move connect, read and spent by
## [method Gen2EffectCommands._check_hit].
const LOCK_ON: int = 94

## Spite, which takes two to five PP off the slot holding the target's last move.
const SPITE: int = 100

## Thief, which takes the target's held item when the thief has none of its own.
const THIEF: int = 105

## Foresight, whose flag drops the target's evasion out of the accuracy sum and
## opens the two Ghost immunities the matchup table keeps past its own marker.
const FORESIGHT: int = 113

## Pursuit, which doubles against a side that is leaving. Two halves: the command
## reads the switching flag, and [method Gen2Battle.take_actions] is what runs
## this move early, in front of the switch it answers.
const PURSUIT: int = 128

## Teleport, which ends a wild battle as a draw with the user out of it. Refused
## outright in a trainer battle, since there is nowhere to teleport away from.
const TELEPORT: int = 153

## Swift, Faint Attack and Vital Throw, which point at `NormalHit` like any other
## attack: their whole difference is one comparison inside
## [method Gen2EffectCommands._check_hit], so this byte has no list.
const ALWAYS_HIT: int = 17

## Jump Kick and Hi Jump Kick, the same shape: `NormalHit` plus the eighth of the
## damage a miss costs the user, which is the tail of
## `BattleCommand_FailureText`.
const JUMP_KICK: int = 45

## The four that write a power over the move's own. Return and Frustration read
## the user's happiness from either end, Magnitude rolls one of seven, and Hidden
## Power reads a power and a type out of the user's DVs.
const RETURN: int = 121
const FRUSTRATION: int = 123
const MAGNITUDE: int = 126
const HIDDEN_POWER: int = 135

## Present, which is a fourth power row that heals the target instead.
const PRESENT: int = 122

## Flail and Reversal, which share [constant Gen2EffectCommands.FIXED_DAMAGE]
## with the four constant-damage effects and are the only branch of it that runs
## the ordinary formula: the power comes off how much health the user has left.
const REVERSAL: int = 99

## Fury Cutter and Triple Kick, the two that multiply a finished figure rather
## than replace it.
const FURY_CUTTER: int = 119
const TRIPLE_KICK: int = 104

## False Swipe, which leaves what it hits standing on one hit point.
const FALSE_SWIPE: int = 101

## Heal Bell, which is the only move that reaches the party behind the Pokémon on
## the field.
const HEAL_BELL: int = 102

## Snore, Tri Attack and Splash. Snore fails unless its user is asleep, Tri
## Attack picks one of three statuses, and Splash does nothing and says so.
const SNORE: int = 92
const TRI_ATTACK: int = 36
const SPLASH: int = 85

## Flame Wheel and Sacred Fire, one list: a burn chance with the user's own thaw
## in front of the faint check.
const FLAME_WHEEL: int = 108
const SACRED_FIRE: int = 125

## Steel Wing: the raise-on-hit run's missing seventh, since
## [constant ATTACK_UP_HIT] and [constant ALL_STATS_UP_HIT] were the only two
## built.
const DEFENSE_UP_HIT: int = 138

## The four that double against a target the ordinary hit would have missed or
## barely grazed. Twister and Stomp carry a flinch chance with it; Gust and
## Earthquake carry nothing, and are the two lists that leave `kingsrock` out.
const TWISTER: int = 146
const STOMP: int = 150
const GUST: int = 149
const EARTHQUAKE: int = 147

## Swagger, the one list that raises a stat on the side it is not acting from.
const SWAGGER: int = 118

## An ordinary attack: say it, spend it, work it out, roll it, apply it, and see
## who is standing. Everything else is this with steps moved.
