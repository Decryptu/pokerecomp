## `DoBattleTransition` (engine/battle/battle_transition.asm): what the overworld
## does between the encounter and the battle screen.
##
## Four animations, picked by the lead's level against the opponent's and by the
## environment, each of them a Poke Ball drawn over the map for a trainer, three
## passes of a palette flash, and then one of four ways of going black. The
## jumptable is walked one entry per frame, which is what `DoBattleTransition`'s
## own `.loop` does with its `DelayFrame`.
##
## Node-free: it answers with a screen of cells, a DMG palette order and a
## per-scanline offset, and the world screen draws those over whatever it was
## already drawing. Nothing here reaches a renderer, so a whole transition can be
## stepped and read headless.

## Which map objects are still in OAM, which is the one thing the transition does
## to the sprites over it. Nothing in the loop writes shadow OAM, so the sprites
## `.InitGFX`'s `UpdateSprites` left stand over the wedges until each outro's own
## setup runs `RespawnPlayerAndOpponent`, which hides every object but the player
## and `hLastTalked`, and `StartTrainerBattle_Finish` runs `ClearSprites`.
