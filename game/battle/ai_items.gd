## What a trainer reaches into its bag for, and what happens when it does:
## `AI_TryItem` and the `EnemyUsed*` routines in `engine/battle/ai/items.asm`. A
## class carries at most two item numbers (`TRNATTR_ITEM1` and `_ITEM2`, already
## in the cache as [method GameData.trainer_attributes]) and its
## `TRNATTR_AI_ITEM_SWITCH` word decides how freely they are spent. Only the enemy
## has any of this: the player's pack has no X items and no in-battle healing
## beyond what [Gen2HeldItem] does on its own.

## The thirteen items the AI knows, at their cartridge numbers.
