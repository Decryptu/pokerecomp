## The volatile flags, for what the one-at-a-time [Gen2Status] byte cannot hold.
## `wPlayerSubStatus1` through `5` folded into one int, since nothing addresses a
## byte alone; counters that belong beside a flag live on [Gen2BattleMon], and
## every flag clears in [method Gen2BattleMon.reset_volatile].

## On the Pokémon that used Mean Look, not the one that cannot leave:
## `BattleCommand_ArenaTrap` sets the user's own `BATTLE_VARS_SUBSTATUS5`.

## Every move its holder uses hits, checked in `CheckHit` ahead of the modifiers.
## Only a trainer's AI sets it; the player's pack has no X items yet.

## With [member Gen2BattleMon.perish_count] beside it. A send-out zeroes the flag
## and leaves the count, but every read of the count is behind the flag.

## The doll's hit points are [member Gen2BattleMon.substitute_hp].

## On the seeded Pokémon, which is why `BattleCommand_ClearHazards` reads the

## Both cost a quarter at the end of the turn and sit on the sufferer.
const NIGHTMARE: int = 1 << 19

## Neither is spent by the hit it answers, so every hit of a multi-hit move is

const IDENTIFIED: int = 1 << 24

## On the Pokémon aimed at, so `CheckHit`'s `.LockOn` reads
## `BATTLE_VARS_SUBSTATUS5_OPP` and consumes it. Its only other reader is the 25%
## AI status-move failure, which this engine does not model.

## `SUBSTATUS_IN_LOOP`, set by `endloop` on the pass that decides how many hits a
## multi-hit move gets and cleared on the pass that runs out. A target that
## faints mid-loop ends the move with it still set, which is the cartridge's own
## arrangement and what `supereffectivelooptext` reads.
