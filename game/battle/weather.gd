extends RefCounted

## `wBattleWeather` and `wWeatherCount` are one value each for the whole battle,
## so the state lives on [Gen2Battle] and this class is pure arithmetic, the
## shape [Gen2Status] and [Gen2Substatus] have. Five readers: the damage formula
## ([method Gen2Damage.calculate_with]), Thunder's accuracy, Solarbeam's charge
## turn, Freeze, and [method Gen2Battle._tick_weather]'s countdown.

## What `BattleCommand_StartRain`, `StartSun` and `StartSandstorm` all write.
## `HandleWeather` decrements before it looks, so this is four turns of weather
## and a fifth that ends it, the setting turn counting as the first.
const TURNS: int = 5

## `DoWeatherModifiers`' multipliers in tenths, which are the type chart's own
## `MORE_EFFECTIVE` and `NOT_VERY_EFFECTIVE` (constants/battle_constants.asm).

## `DoWeatherModifiers` floors a zero result at one and answers `$FFFF` on a
## two-byte overflow.

## read only when no type row matched.

## What a Sandstorm takes each turn, `GetEighthMaxHP`'s at-least-one eighth.
