class_name Gen2Accuracy
extends RefCounted

## Whether a move connects.
##
## Accuracy is a byte out of 255, not a percentage: "100%" stores 255 and "90%"
## stores 229. Kept as the byte, because the roll is against it and a stored 255
## is a special case that never misses.
##
## Accuracy and evasion use their own multiplier table, a different shape from
## the other stats', so -1 accuracy and -1 Attack are different fractions.

## The move accuracy that cannot miss. Anything the stages leave below this rolls.
const ALWAYS_HITS: int = 255

## What each stage from -6 to +6 multiplies accuracy by, as the numerator and
## denominator pair the cartridge stores.
const STAGE_MULTIPLIERS: Array = [
	[33, 100], [36, 100], [43, 100], [50, 100], [60, 100], [75, 100],
	[1, 1],
	[133, 100], [166, 100], [2, 1], [233, 100], [133, 50], [3, 1],
]


## The chance a move connects, out of 255.
##
## Evasion reads the same table from the other end rather than a second table:
## +2 evasion is the multiplier accuracy uses at -2.
##
## [param foresight] drops both sides' stages, not only evasion, and only when
## the evasion stage is at least the accuracy stage, so it cannot undo an
## accuracy the attacker raised.

## applied once at the end, so an accuracy raised past 255 and then halved by
## evasion lands where the arithmetic puts it rather than at 127.

## Rolls a hit against a chance out of 255.
##
## A chance of exactly 255 connects without rolling. Rolling would miss one time
## in 256, and Crystal goes out of its way not to. [param generation] is
## `MoveHitTest`, which does not: pret's own comment there says even the highest
## accuracy is 255 in 256, and Swift is exempt because the routine returns above
## the roll rather than because 255 is special.
