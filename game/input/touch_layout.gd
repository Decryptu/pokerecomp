## Where the on-screen controller's four clusters sit, how big they are and how
## much of the screen they hide.

## Geometry only: [Gen2TouchPad] draws and reads touches, and this answers where
## everything is. Keeping them apart is what lets the settings page show a live
## preview and lets a test check placement without a viewport.
##
## Positions are stored as a fraction of the area the controller was given, not
## as pixels, so a layout arranged on a phone still means the same thing on a
## tablet, in the other orientation, or after the window is resized. Portrait and
## landscape keep separate positions, because a cluster reachable by the thumb in
## one is in the middle of the screen in the other.
