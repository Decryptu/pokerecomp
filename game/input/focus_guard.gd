class_name Gen2FocusGuard
extends Node

## Gives a controller somewhere to start. Godot moves focus on `ui_up` and the
## rest of that family, but only once something already has focus, and nothing
## does when a screen opens. A ring is only put up while the player is on a
## keyboard or a pad, and never taken away again, because a click that dropped
## focus would empty the field the click had just filled. A modal takes the whole
## guard with it: everything below is still focusable, so without that the
## geometric search joins a control in the modal to one on the page behind. Add
## one with [method attach] and call [method refresh] when the screen changes.

## Nodes in this group are modal: while one is in the tree, it is the only part
## of the screen the guard looks at. Named rather than typed so the guard owes
## nothing to the launcher, and joined by whoever puts a layer over a screen
## ([Gen2LauncherSheet] is the one that does today).
const MODAL_GROUP: StringName = &"gen2_focus_modal"

## Where focus should land when there is somewhere better than the first control
## in tree order. A screen whose first control is a corner toggle would otherwise
## start a pad there rather than on what the screen is about.
