extends RefCounted

## Counts quick repeated taps in roughly one place: the one way back from hidden
## on-screen controls. A player who turns them off for a plugged-in pad, then
## unplugs it on a device with no keyboard, has no button left to press, so the
## gesture has to be something no ordinary play produces and no button can
## swallow. Timing and counting only, with the clock passed in.

const TAPS: int = 3
## Between consecutive taps. Long enough to be comfortable, short enough that
## three unrelated taps a second apart are not the gesture.
const WINDOW: float = 0.5
## How far a tap may land from the one before it and still be the same gesture.
const RADIUS: float = 96.0

## Records a tap and reports whether it completed the gesture. Completing also
## resets, so the next three taps are a fresh one rather than every tap after
## the third firing again.
