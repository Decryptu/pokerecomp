extends RefCounted

## The eight buttons the hardware had, and the input actions that stand for them.

## Every screen that reads the cartridge's own controls speaks this vocabulary
## and nothing else, so a key, a pad button and an on-screen button are already
## the same thing by the time a screen sees one. What a device has to do to
## produce a button is [Gen2InputActions]' business, and which device the player
## is holding is [Gen2InputDevice]'s.
