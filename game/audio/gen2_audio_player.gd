## samples the APU produced from it.

## The generator's depth, which Godot rounds up to 4,096 output frames: seven
## driver frames. This is capacity, not latency: [member _target_frames] is how
## much of it is kept filled, and the rest is headroom a long frame is caught up
## into. See [method _service_timeline].

## this player adds before the platform's own: three frames is 50 ms at

## quarter of the buffer's 125 ms depth, about two driver frames between two
