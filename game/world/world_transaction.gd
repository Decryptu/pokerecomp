## The commit boundary every world-owned transaction here shares.
##
## A mart purchase, Kurt's apricorns, a party request, a heal, a field item and
## the pack's TOSS all do the same four things around whatever they actually
## change: validate the save they were handed, build a candidate from it,
## validate that candidate against the world it now describes and write it, and
## put the live world back when any of the three refuses. That shape was
## repeated in three hosts; it lives here instead.
##
## Scene-free and save-model-free: it validates through [Gen2SaveValidator] and
## writes through [Gen2SaveStore], and knows nothing about what the caller
## changed.

## Validates [param save] and returns a candidate to work on, which is a full
## copy rather than a reference: nothing a caller writes to it reaches the live
## save until [method commit] succeeds.

## Snapshots the world into [param candidate], validates it, writes it when
## [param persist], and copies it back over [param save]. Any refusal restores
## the world to [param before] and reports which step said no, so a caller never
## has to unwind by hand.

	## forgotten here fails there.
