class_name Gen2WorldScriptRunner
extends RefCounted

## Bounded, scene-free execution of the supported overworld script commands.
##
## A runner owns one event invocation. It never opens a ROM and it never
## changes the world state until the invocation reaches END or ENDCALLBACK.
## Text and explicit warps are returned as structured pauses for the screen or
## another caller to acknowledge.
