## `CrystalIntro` (engine/movie/intro.asm): the movie between the GameFreak logo
## and the title screen. Twenty-eight scenes behind one jumptable, stepped once
## per hardware frame. Half of them are setup, loading a sheet, a 32x32 BG map and
## its attribute plane and a palette run; the other half animate for a fixed
## number of frames by writing the palettes, `hSCX`, `hSCY`, `wLYOverrides` and a
## handful of sprite animation structs. This owns all of that state and
## [Gen2IntroMoviePage] turns it into pixels, the same split the credits use.
## Crystal only: `GoldSilverIntro` is a different movie.

## `wBGPals2` and the `wOBPals2` behind it, which is what the screen shows.
##
## Every scene's `ld bc, 16 palettes` runs off the end of the background
## buffer and into the object one, which is where the sprites get their colours:
## the Unown's purple, Pichu's yellow and Wooper's blue are all in the second
## half of a run whose first half is a scene's backgrounds.

## them each OAM set takes. The geometry is [Gen2IntroMoviePage]'s; only the
## count belongs here, because a full buffer stops the sprite pass:
## `UpdateAnimFrame` returns carry at `wShadowOAMEnd` and
## `DoNextFrameForAllSprites` answers it with `jr c, .done`, so a struct behind
## the overflow loses its own sequence for that frame as well as its picture.
## `IntroScene10` is where this movie reaches it, at forty-one.
