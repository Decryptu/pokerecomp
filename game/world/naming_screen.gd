## `engine/menus/naming_screen.asm`'s model: which keyboard is live, where the
## cursor is, what a press does to the name being typed and what comes out at the
## end. Scene-free, so the whole walk can be tested without drawing it. The name is
## kept as the cartridge keeps it, a fixed buffer of raw codes seeded with
## NAMINGSCREEN_UNDERLINE and NAMINGSCREEN_MIDDLELINE rather than a String,
## because every routine here reads and writes those two markers.

## The six keyboards in block order, which is the order they are imported in:
## `data/text/name_input_chars.asm`'s four and `mail_input_chars.asm`'s two.

## What `NamingScreen_GetCursorPosition` answers. 0 is a letter; the other three

## screens: mail's own table repeats $00, $30 and $60 the same way.

## `NamingScreen_IsTargetBox`: a box keyboard is six rows and a name keyboard
## five, so the command row is row 5 or row 4.
var is_box: bool = false
## `_ComposeMailMessage` rather than `NamingScreen`: a six-row, ten-column
## keyboard of its own, a two-line entry with a fixed break in the middle, and

## `NamingScreen_GetLastCharacter`: the code under the cursor, read off the
## tilemap at the cursor's own stride. Returns 0 on the command row, which the
## caller never reaches because `.a` answers the command first.

## `_ComposeMailMessage`'s `.a` and `.b` tails: the `<NEXT>` at
## `MAIL_LINE_LENGTH` is a buffer position rather than a character, so an entry
## that lands on it steps past it in whichever direction it arrived from and
## writes the break back. Both tails run only when the length is exactly the
## line length, so nothing else on either screen is touched.

## row.
func press_start() -> void:

## `NamingScreen_StoreEntry`: every marker still in the buffer becomes a
## terminator, so the name is what was typed and nothing behind it.
## `NamingScreen_StoreEntry` whole: the buffer at its own length with every
## marker turned into a terminator and everything else left where it is. Mail
## needs the whole buffer rather than the run in front of the first marker,
## because its `<NEXT>` sits inside it and its second line sits behind that.
