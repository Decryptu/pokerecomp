## `engine/menus/intro_menu.asm`'s `NewGame`, less the title screen that reaches
## it: `PlayerProfileSetup`'s gender question, then `OakSpeech`, then the world.
## Its own screen rather than a state of the overworld because that is where the
## cartridge puts it: `NewGame` reaches `InitializeWorld` only after both have
## returned. Nothing is written to disk until the run is over, so
## `Gen2SaveStore.create_new_game` is called once, at the end. That is also why
## `Gen2SaveValidator`'s rule that a save has a trainer needs no exception: the
## save does not exist until there is one.

## Emitted with the written save, for a driver that hosts this screen itself.
## The scene's own handler changes to the overworld.
