## `_UnownPuzzle`, the sliding-piece puzzle the four Ruins of Alph chambers open.
## The board is `wPuzzlePieces`, six by six cells holding a piece number or zero;
## only the inner four by four is the picture and the ring around it is where the
## pieces are scattered, less the four cells the START>CANCEL box stands on.
## Node-free and scene-free, with the generator injected. Three things a reading
## gets wrong: the cursor walks cells rather than tiles and its edges are
## hand-listed; a press is refused rather than ignored, both bad presses reaching
## `UnownPuzzle_InvalidAction`; and holding a piece stops the cursor blinking.

## `wPuzzlePieces` is six by six and `puzcoord` is `row * 6 + column`.
const COLUMNS: int = 6
const ROWS: int = 6
const CELLS: int = COLUMNS * ROWS
## The sixteen pieces, which is also the inner four by four.
const PIECES: int = 16
const PIECE_COLUMNS: int = 4

## `.PuzzlePieceInitialPositions`: the whole top row and then the two end columns
## of the five below it, which is every ring cell the START>CANCEL box does not
## stand on.
const START_CELLS: Array[int] = [
	0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
	6, 11,
	12, 17,
	18, 23,
	24, 29,
	30, 35,
]

## The two cells `.right_overflow` and `.left_overflow` jump between, which is
## how the cursor crosses the START>CANCEL box without entering it.
const BOX_LEFT_CELL: int = 30
const BOX_RIGHT_CELL: int = 35

## `.d_down`'s four `ret z`: the bottom inner row steps nowhere.
const NO_STEP_DOWN: Array[int] = [25, 26, 27, 28]

## `JoyTextDelay`'s own repeat, which is what makes a held direction walk. The
## frame a button is newly pressed reloads `wTextDelayFrames` with fifteen and
## acts; after that `.restartframedelay` acts only on the frames the counter has
## reached zero and reloads it with five.
const REPEAT_DELAY_FRAMES: int = 15
const REPEAT_RATE_FRAMES: int = 5

## `hVBlankCounter and $10`: the empty cursor is drawn on the frames bit 4 is
## set and cleared off the screen on the rest.
const BLINK_MASK: int = 0x10

## The six sounds, as constants/sfx_constants.asm's own indices. The comments
## there are hexadecimal and the run has no gaps, so each is its position in the
## enum. `SFX_PLACE_PUZZLE_PIECE_DOWN` is shared with `OWCutAnimation`.

## `InitUnownPuzzlePiecePositions`, which walks 1 to 16 and drops each on a
## random free start cell, rerolling on a taken one. Rerolling is a permutation
## whatever the generator answers, so the shuffle is drawn as one rather than
## looped: the roll order is the same set of outcomes and costs no unbounded
## loop, and no caller can see the difference.
