## `GameFreakPresentsScene` and the sprite animation beside it
## (`engine/movie/splash.asm`), which is the second half of `SplashScreen`.
##
## Two cartridges, two sequences. Crystal bounces a Ditto in on
## `BattleAnim_Sine_e`, waits, and fades its pink to orange as it turns into the
## logo; Gold and Silver throw a star that leaves the logo behind it, rotate
## `rOBP1` until the logo is yellow, and spray sparkles out of it. The words
## underneath are the same two `PlaceString`s on both, at different rows.
##
## Every frame here is a frame the cartridge spends. The scene jumptable and the
## sprite's own jumptable run in one `advance_frame()`, in the order that
## profile's loop calls them: Crystal's `.joy_loop` runs the scene and then
## `PlaySpriteAnimations`, Gold's `GameFreakPresentsFrame` the other way round.
##
## Scene-free: a host reads [method sprites], [method words] and
## [method fade_step] and draws them.

## `GameFreakLogoSpriteAnim`'s own jumptable, which is the Ditto's, and Gold's
## three objects. A host maps each onto the sheet it draws from.

## `depixel 10, 11, 4, 0`, which both profiles use for the Ditto, the star and
## the logo, and `depixel 11, 11` for a sparkle. These are shadow-OAM
## coordinates, so a screen position is eight less across and sixteen less down.

## `GameFreakPresentsEnd` reaches `ClearSprites` only after `ClearTilemap`, whose

## The two `PlaceString`s. Crystal writes them with `CopyBytes` at (5,10) and

## `NUM_SPRITE_ANIM_STRUCTS`. `_InitSpriteAnimStruct` walks the array for the
