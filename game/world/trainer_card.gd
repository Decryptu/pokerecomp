## What the trainer card prints (`engine/menus/trainer_card.asm`), as pages a
## screen can draw.
##
## Everything here comes from the save and the world the card is opened over:
## `wPlayerName`, `wPlayerID` and `wMoney` on the top half, `wPokedexCaught`'s
## set bits and `wGameTimeHours`/`wGameTimeMinutes` on page 1, and the two badge
## bytes behind pages 2 and 3.

## `TrainerCard.Jumptable` indexes, halved: each page's LoadGFX and Joypad states
## are one page here, since nothing needs the frame the graphics land on.
