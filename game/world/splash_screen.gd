## `SplashScreen` (`engine/movie/splash.asm`), as far as this project has the art
## for it.
##
## The source runs four things before a new game: the copyright screen, the
## GameFreak logo animation, the intro movie, and the title screen. The movie is
## the cartridge's own: `CrystalIntro` through [Gen2IntroMoviePage] on Crystal
## and `GoldSilverIntro` through [Gen2GoldSilverIntroPage] on the other two.
## [Gen2BootCinema] is started with the phases this cache has art for; a phase it
## has none for is skipped rather than held on a blank screen for the frames it
## would have taken.
##
## The pacing is the source's throughout. The copyright half is ten frames of
## blank and the screen for a hundred, with no button read at all, since
## `DelayFrames` does not look at the joypad; the GameFreak half is
## `GameFreakPresentsScene` and its sprite, which do read one, and a press there
## ends the animation early through [method Gen2BootCinema.skip_presents]. The
## title screen reads a held button rather than a press, because every branch of
## `TitleScreenMain` is `hJoyDown`.

## Emitted once the last phase this host can draw has finished.
