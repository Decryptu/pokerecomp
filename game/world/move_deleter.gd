## `MoveDeletion` (`engine/events/move_deleter.asm`), the rules half.
## Same shape as [Gen2NameRater], one house further on: an introduction and a
## `YesNoBox`, the party list `SelectMonFromParty` opens, two endings that need
## no move, `ChooseMoveToDelete`'s own list, a second `YesNoBox` and
## `.DeleteMove`. [Gen2MoveDeleterScreen] is the routine; this holds nothing.

## The endings `PrintText` closes on, by the stub each branch loads into hl.
const ENDING_EGG: StringName = &"egg"
const ENDING_ONLY_ONE_MOVE: StringName = &"knows_one"
const ENDING_DECLINED: StringName = &"come_again"
const ENDING_FORGOT: StringName = &"forgot"

## `constants/sfx_constants.asm`'s SFX_MOVE_DELETED, played between two
## `WaitSFX`es once the slot has been cleared.
const SFX_MOVE_DELETED: int = 0x97


## Which ending [param mon] reaches once it has been chosen, or `&""` for the
## one member the routine carries on with.
## `.onlyonemove` reads `wPartyMon1Moves + 1`, which is the *second* slot rather
## than a move count, so a member whose second slot is empty is refused whatever
## stands behind it.
