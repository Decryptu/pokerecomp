## `DisplayUnownWords`: the word a Ruins of Alph chamber wall spells, as the box
## it is drawn in and the tiles that draw it. The letters are not font glyphs and
## are not `UnownFont`, which is the Pokedex's own sheet:
## `_DisplayUnownWords_CopyWord` computes a tile number from the character itself
## and places a 2x2 block of the *tileset's* own tiles, which is why the chambers
## ship a tileset holding an alphabet. So this needs no import: the word comes from
## `UnownWalls` and the tiles from the tileset the chamber is already drawn with.

## `constants/charmap.asm`'s `unown` charmap, `$10 * (i / 8) + 2 * i` over
## "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-": eight letters to a row of the sheet, each two
## tiles wide and two rows tall, so a row of letters steps a whole $10.
const ALPHABET: String = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ-"
const LETTERS_PER_ROW: int = 8

## `_DisplayUnownWords_FillAttr`'s split: everything below 'Y' is drawn out of
## VRAM bank 1 with `OAM_BANK1`, and the last three letters out of bank 0.
const BANK_SPLIT: int = 0x60

## `constants/tileset_constants.asm`: the palette both halves of the word are
## given, whatever the tileset's own palette map says about those tiles.
const PALETTE_BROWN: int = 5

## The three characters `.ConvertChar` branches away from the arithmetic for,
## because their tiles do not sit in the alphabet block: top-left, top-right,
## bottom-left, bottom-right.

## `MenuHeaders_UnownWalls`' `menu_coords 9 - n, 4, 10 + n, 9`, where n is the
## word's length: the box is built around the word rather than the word fitted

## `tiles` are tile numbers in the chamber's own tileset. `bank1` says which of
## the two graphics blocks they are in, which is `OAM_BANK1` in the attribute
## map and [constant RomLayout.TILESET_BLOCK_STRIDE] into the flat strip here.
