## Scene-free tables and gates for the overworld field moves
## (engine/events/overworld.asm).

## Cut, Surf and Whirlpool follow CutFunction's shape: badge, faced tile, then a
## change the text acknowledge commits. Strength is the odd one (BADGE_PLAIN),
## Flash checks the map rather than a tile ([method Gen2WorldPalette.is_dark]),
## and Headbutt checks a tile and no badge, its roll being [Gen2WorldTreemon]'s.

## constants/move_constants.asm, whose comment column is hex. The submenu, not
## the functions, is what checks a party Pokemon knows these.
