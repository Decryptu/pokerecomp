## four-cell table and the game looks it up in a second table before letting
## ordinary walking in; keeping that lookup here leaves the code itself available

## `CollisionPermissionTable` entry for entry, the same 256 bytes in all three
## games, carried whole rather than as a list of interesting codes: a code left off
## such a list silently becomes ordinary ground, which is how the waterfall,
