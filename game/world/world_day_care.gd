## `engine/events/daycare.asm` and `engine/pokemon/breeding.asm`, the rules half.
##
## The two Day-Care slots are world state rather than party members: the
## cartridge keeps them in `wBreedMon1` and `wBreedMon2`, which are boxmon
## structs beside the flag byte that says whether each is occupied. This answers
## what the three routines ask of that state and nothing else; the boxes,
## presses and party list are [Gen2DayCareScreen]'s.
##
## Every duration and every roll here is the source's own. What a reading gets
## wrong is which parent a field comes from: `wBreedMotherOrNonDitto` is set once
## in `DayCare_InitBreeding` and then read by four routines that each pick a
## *different* side of it, so it is computed once here as
## [method mother_or_non_ditto] and passed down.

## `wDayCareMan`'s four bits (constants/ram_constants.asm).
