## Scene-free runtime access to one imported Generation 2 map.
##
## The API works in walk cells: every cell is a 2x2 group of 8x8 graphics
## tiles. It owns player position, camera framing and live object state, while
## event flags are supplied through a separate scene-free world state.

## How long each scripted step command takes, from the `STEP_*` speed it passes
## to `InitStep` (engine/overworld/movement.asm) and that row of `StepVectors`.
##
## Every command here reaches `InitStep`: `NormalStep`, `SlideStep`, `JumpStep`
## and `TurningStep` all call it and differ in the step type they set over the
## top, a spin for the three turning rows and a jump for the three jumping ones.
## The turning rows keep the direction the command names; `turn_away` does not
## reverse it.
##
## The frames here are one cell's. The three jumping rows cover two: `JumpStep`
## sets `STEP_TYPE_NPC_JUMP` or `STEP_TYPE_PLAYER_JUMP`, whose jumptables are
## `.Jump` then `.Land` with a `GetNextTile` between them, so each spends this
## many frames and the command lands two cells on (JUMP_STEP_KINDS below).
##
## `turn_step` is the one command that is not here: `TurnStep` sets
## STEP_TYPE_TURN, never calls `InitStep`, and `StepFunction_Turn` is two frames
## of standing and two of the new facing. It is filed with `turn_head` below.
