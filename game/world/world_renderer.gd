## Draws the visible map page and the development player marker in hardware
## pixels. It does not own map state; call [method set_world] when the API
## changes or [method refresh] after a movement.
##
## The surface is the cartridge's 160x144 unless the world has been given a
## larger [member Gen2WorldAPI.view_pixels], in which case the map fills all of
## it: the connected maps the graph places around this one are drawn as well, on
## [Gen2WorldMapLayer] quads under the sprites, and the border block fills
## whatever no map covers.

## `.InitSprite` (engine/overworld/map_objects.asm) writes an object's OAM y as
## `add OAM_Y_OFS - 4` against a plain `add OAM_X_OFS` on the other axis, so a
## 16x16 overworld sprite stands four pixels above its own cell and nothing
## shifts it sideways. Every map object shares the one write: the emote, the
## shadow, the boulder dust and the shaking grass are tracking objects that copy
## the tracked object's `OBJECT_SPRITE_Y` and go through it too, and the jump
## arc, the tracking bob and the fishing rod are offsets added in front of it.
## The tuft of grass over a sprite's legs is background rather than OAM and takes
## no lift; it moves with the sprite because OAM_PRIO is what draws it.
