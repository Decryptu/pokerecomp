class_name Gen2ModRefusal
extends RefCounted

## Why a mod was refused, said to a player rather than to a log.
##
## One table for every reason the mod layer produces: the installer's, the index
## feed's, the manifest reader's and the host's registrations alike. The launcher
## and the index dialog each used to keep their own, covering different halves of
## the same set, so a mod refused through the wrong screen showed a raw
## StringName. A new reason is worded here, once, and both screens have it.
##
## Anything unworded falls back to the reason itself, which is a poor line but an
## honest one: it names something a search finds.

## Reasons that read the same wherever they come from. A [code]%s[/code] is
## filled with the result's own [code]detail[/code]; a reason wanting anything
## else is a branch in [method text].
