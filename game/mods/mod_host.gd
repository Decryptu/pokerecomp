class_name Gen2ModHost
extends RefCounted

## What a mod is allowed to change, and the only way it gets to change it.
##
## A mod never touches scene nodes or engine internals: it is handed this host,
## registers what it provides, and is done. All it reaches is cartridge content
## through [GameData] and live world state through [Gen2WorldAPI].
##
## The world renderer and the battle renderer are replaceable this way. Neither
## requires 2D, so a renderer building geometry from the same block and collision
## data is a registration rather than a fork, and [method select_view] swaps
## between them, which is why the contract is a factory. A mod registering both
## under its own id is saying they are one view of one world, and choosing that
## view is one choice: see [method select_view].
##
## Mods are interpreted GDScript: iOS forbids JIT and runtime native loading, so
## a compiled extension is not an option for a distributed mod.

## Where installed mods live. Under user:// because a mod is not part of the
## build and must survive an update of it.
const ROOT: String = "user://mods"
## The methods a world renderer has to provide. A registration that is missing
## one is refused at registration, where the mod's name is still in hand, rather
## than failing on the first frame it is asked to draw.
const WORLD_RENDERER_METHODS: Array[String] = [
	"set_world", "set_time_of_day", "refresh", "refresh_animation",
]
## The methods a battle renderer has to provide.
const BATTLE_RENDERER_METHODS: Array[String] = [
	"set_battle_data", "set_view", "refresh",
]
## Optional. A renderer defining this and answering false gets the screen's own
## rectangle at window resolution instead of the 160x144 viewport. A view built
## from geometry cannot be drawn into a 160x144 buffer and magnified, so this is
## what makes a 3D or HD renderer possible at all.
##
## A renderer that does not define it draws in hardware pixels, which is what the
## built-in ones do and what a tile-recolouring mod wants. Shared by both
## renderer kinds.
const RENDERER_SURFACE_METHOD: String = "uses_hardware_viewport"
## Optional. Called with the native layer's size in window pixels when it is
## created and whenever the window changes it. Only reached by a renderer that
## asked for the native layer. Shared by both renderer kinds.
const RENDERER_RESIZE_METHOD: String = "set_native_size"
## Optional, world renderers only. Called with the screen's [Gen2WorldEffects]
## when the renderer is built. It holds the sprites the engine draws over the
## map rather than as objects, and `offset()`, the earthquake's own scroll, which
## is the background's and moves no sprite. All of it is presentation with no
## world state behind it, so a renderer that draws its own effects can ignore it.
const RENDERER_EFFECTS_METHOD: String = "set_effects"
## Optional, world renderers only. Called with the screen's [Gen2WorldActors]
## when the renderer is built. It holds the sprites registered mods put in the
## world, already resolved to the same [Gen2WorldSprite] the map's own objects
## are drawn from, so a renderer draws them with its objects or ignores them.
const RENDERER_ACTORS_METHOD: String = "set_actors"
## Optional, world renderers only. Called with the screen's [Gen2WorldEncounters]
## when the renderer is built. The population itself is drawn through
## [constant RENDERER_ACTORS_METHOD]; what is only here is the shiny pulse, which
## is battle-animation OAM over the map and which a renderer may ignore.
const RENDERER_ENCOUNTERS_METHOD: String = "set_encounters"
## Optional, world renderers only. Called with one step of a map fade: the
## palette order `DmgToCgbTimePals` applies to every palette on screen, and
## `FillWhiteBGColor` beside it on the way out. The host spends the fade's own
## frames either way, so a renderer that ignores this cuts to the new map on the
## frame the cartridge is at its whitest rather than desynchronising.
const RENDERER_FADE_METHOD: String = "set_fade"
## Optional, battle renderers only. Called with a [Gen2BattleWorldContext] once
## per battle, before the first [code]set_view[/code], saying where the fight is
## happening: a renderer staging it on the map needs that and one drawing the
## white field ignores it. A battle started outside the world passes null.
const RENDERER_WORLD_CONTEXT_METHOD: String = "set_world_context"
## Optional, world renderers only. Offered every input event the world screen did
## not use, so a renderer can own camera pitch or first person; answering true
## consumes the event. The screen decides first, so a renderer can never take a
## movement or interaction key: it reads world state and must not write it, and
## free-roam movement is the separate pose layer docs/MODS.md describes.
##
## Implement this rather than [method Node._input] or
## [method Node._unhandled_input], which are offered events before the screen
## decides and so race the gameplay keys instead of taking what is left.
const RENDERER_INPUT_METHOD: String = "handle_world_input"
## Optional, battle renderers only. The same seam on the battle side: every event
## [Gen2BattleScreen] did not claim, so a renderer composing its own shot can let
## someone steer it. Answering true consumes the event.
##
## A [Gen2Button] never arrives here, on either side. The screen routes every one
## of them to whatever owns it first, so a text box, the forget-move list and
## ball selection all take their press before a renderer could see it, and what
## is left is pointer and stick motion the screen has no opinion about.
const RENDERER_BATTLE_INPUT_METHOD: String = "handle_battle_input"
## Optional, both renderer kinds. How opaque the screen draws the field of its
## own text box while this renderer is on the native layer, from 0 for invisible
## to 1 for the cartridge's own solid white. The frame's lines and the glyphs are
## ink and stay opaque, so nothing becomes harder to read.
##
## Only honoured for a renderer that answered [constant
## RENDERER_SURFACE_METHOD] false: a renderer drawing in hardware pixels paints
## the background the box sits on, and a hole in the box would show the window
## behind the screen rather than the map.
const RENDERER_INTERFACE_OPACITY_METHOD: String = "interface_opacity"
## Optional, both renderer kinds. Called with the rectangle the screen's text box
## covers, in hardware pixels, whenever it changes, and with an empty rectangle
## when no box is on screen. A renderer composing around the box reads this
## instead of assuming the standard twenty by six at row twelve.
const RENDERER_TEXT_BOX_METHOD: String = "set_text_box_rect"
## Optional, both renderer kinds. Called when a screen laid out in 160x144 takes
## the picture over the view, and again when it gives it back.
##
## A renderer drawing in hardware pixels needs nothing: the screen paints its own
## letterbox around the rectangle and that mask is inside the hardware viewport.
## A native-layer renderer is not covered by it, deliberately, since the mask
## would crop a view that already filled the whole surface. This is how such a
## renderer closes its own surround instead, and `DoBattleTransition` is the case
## it exists for: twenty by eighteen cells cannot be widened, so the wedge
## closing over a filled window is a shape only the view drawing that window can
## draw. A renderer that does not take it keeps drawing what it was drawing.
const RENDERER_INTERFACE_MASK_METHOD: String = "set_interface_masked"
## Optional, both renderer kinds, and only meaningful on the native layer. Called
## beside [constant RENDERER_RESIZE_METHOD] with the cartridge's own 160x144
## screen expressed in that layer's pixels.
##
## Every hardware-pixel number a renderer is handed -- the text box's rectangle,
## first -- has to land somewhere inside the surface it draws on. Framed, that
## mapping was the surface itself, because it was a whole multiple of 160x144.
## A surface filling the window is not, so this is where the screen is.
