extends RefCounted

## A published list of mods a player chose to follow.
##
## An index is metadata only: a JSON feed naming mods that live wherever their
## authors put them. Nothing here installs anything. A chosen entry hands its
## download to [Gen2ModInstaller] like any other archive, with the listed id
## required to match, so appearing in a feed buys a mod no trust that picking
## the same file by hand would not.
##
## One index ships with the game: this project's own, in [constant
## BUILT_IN_FEED]. It is a listing and nothing more, so a build carrying it has
## installed nothing and downloaded nothing until the player picks a mod out of
## it. Every other index is the player trusting a publisher we did not choose
## for them, so adding one is always their act and only theirs.
##
## Everything above "fetching" is pure: no HTTP, no filesystem. The feed format
## is a contract with people we will never meet, so its rules are worth testing
## without a network.

## Feeds declare this. A later format may reuse a field name for something else,
## so an unknown version is refused rather than parsed hopefully.

## The project's own index, followed by every build. It is not in

## a build without it gets it too, which storing it once on first run would not
## do.
