## One list of every mod the player can see, grouped by where it came from. A
## source is a followed index; a mod that no index lists came from a file the
## player chose. That is the whole ownership rule and it needs nothing written
## down: uninstalling one from a source leaves it listed and re-downloadable,
## while uninstalling one that came from a file removes the only copy there was.
## Pure: it takes what [Gen2ModHost], [Gen2ModIndex] and [Gen2ModState] already
## answer and decides nothing about the network or the screen.

## The group a mod nothing lists belongs to.

## The groups to draw, in the order to draw them: each followed source that has
## anything in it, in the order the player added them, then the file group.
##
## [param sources] is [method Gen2ModIndex.followed]'s rows, [param listings] is
## feed to that feed's entries, and [param manifests] is
## [method Gen2ModHost.manifests]. A group is
## `{feed, label, rows}`; see [method _row] for a row.
