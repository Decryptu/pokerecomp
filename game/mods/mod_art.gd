extends RefCounted

## A mod's own pictures: the icon the launcher draws beside its name, and the
## thumbnail a listing site shows for it. Both are optional and neither is
## declared for the usual mod, since dropping `icon.png` beside `mod.json` is the
## whole of it and a convention an author has to read a document to obey is one
## most will not. A manifest may still name another path. The game never draws a
## thumbnail; it is resolved here anyway so one rule covers both files.

## Tried in order, and the first that exists wins. PNG leads because an icon is
## 32x32 pixel art off the cartridge, where lossy compression only costs.

## a mod's icon sits beside the game's own art without resampling.

## Icon bytes to the texture decoded from them, because the launcher rebuilds
## its whole list on any change and would otherwise decode every icon again.
## Keyed by content rather than by path: an icon file is a kilobyte, so reading
## it back is nothing beside decoding it, and a reinstalled mod cannot be drawn
## with the picture the version before it had. Modification time is not enough
## for that, since a replace inside the same second keeps it.
