class_name Gen2ModManifest
extends RefCounted

## One mod's declared identity, read from its `mod.json`.
##
## Parsing is separate from loading, so the launcher can list what is installed
## and say why something was refused without running a line of mod code.
##
## [code]api_version[/code] is [Gen2ModHost]'s contract, not the mod's own
## version. A mod built against a NEWER host is refused rather than allowed to
## fail somewhere less obvious; one built against an older one still runs, since
## every version so far has only added to the contract.

const FILENAME: String = "mod.json"
## Bumped when the host contract changes in a way an existing mod would notice.
## 2 added [method Gen2ModHost.register_visible_encounters].
## 3 added mart rows and named action axes.
## 4 added types, type matchups and mod-supplied art as content, and
## [method Gen2ModHost.register_event_mutator].
## 5 added [member Gen2WorldAPI.rules], the run's own divergence flags.
## 6 added `occupied` to the visible-encounter context, which is the only way a
## provider can tell that a cell has an NPC or an item ball standing on it.
## 7 gave a world actor an optional `interact` and an optional `take_requests`
## outbox, an optional `emote` on a `sprites()` entry, and the host
## [method Gen2ModHost.request_hidden_item] over
## [method Gen2WorldAPI.hidden_items].
## 8 added [method Gen2ModHost.register_stats_page], a page of a Pokémon's stats
## screen past the cartridge's own three.
## 9 added the evolution an item causes, on the item record itself.
## 10 is the screen that fills the window: the connection graph past the
## cartridge's three-block margin ([method Gen2WorldAPI.map_placements],
## [method Gen2WorldAPI.expanded_block_at],
## [method Gen2WorldAPI.connected_map_objects]), the wider drawn surface
## ([member Gen2WorldAPI.view_pixels]) and
## [constant Gen2ModHost.RENDERER_INTERFACE_MASK_METHOD] beside
## [constant Gen2ModHost.RENDERER_SCREEN_RECT_METHOD]. A view on the native
## layer needs it: whether the host claims the zoom keys and paints its letterbox
## over that layer is a behaviour no mod can feature-detect.
##
## 13 is the five registrations that let a mod change how the game is played
## without reaching a screen: [method Gen2ModHost.register_field_move_source],
## [method Gen2ModHost.register_repel_renewal],
## [method Gen2ModHost.register_catch_experience],
## [method Gen2ModHost.register_battle_info], and a start-menu entry's own
## [constant Gen2ModHost.START_ACTIONS] plus its `visible` predicate.
##
## 15 added a visible encounter's own `glow`, the optional
## `{color, amount}` on an `encounters()` entry that walks the Pokemon's four
## colours toward a light. It is presentation and changes no DV, no battle and
## no roll; the host rounds the amount onto
## [constant Gen2WorldEncounters.GLOW_RUNGS] itself, because both renderers cache
## a sprite texture per set of four colours and neither evicts. Nine amounts, so
## a subtle glow still has a cycle after the rounding.
##
## An optional `icon` or `thumbnail` is deliberately NOT a contract change: a
## host that has never heard of either ignores the field, so a mod that ships
## art still installs on an older launcher and simply has no face there. A glow
## is the same shape in the other direction: a mod may send one to a host that
## drops it and the Pokemon simply does not glow, which is why `api_version` 15
## is only needed by a mod that requires the mark to appear.
##
## 16 is the shiny seam, three registrations a mod that changes what comes out of
## the grass needs: [method Gen2ModHost.register_shiny_rolls], the count of DV
## words one wild is drawn with; [method Gen2ModHost.request_item_gift], which is
## [method Gen2ModHost.request_hidden_item]'s twin for an item no map gives; and
## [method Gen2ModHost.inventory], the live bag a non-renderer mod otherwise has
## no way to read. Only the first two are contract: a mod may feature-detect the
## bag but not a roll it never sees taken.
##
## 17 is the one break in the list. `view["entrance"]` is gone and
## `view["battlers"]` stands in its place, carrying the same five fields plus
## `visible` and `scale`: everything that happens to a battler after the entrance
## used to be readable only as `bg_map` edits, and the two blocks describe the
## same thing at different moments. Carrying both would have meant a renderer
## reading one for the opening and the other for the fight, so the fold is the
## contract. See [method Gen2BattleScreen.battler_side].

## The oldest contract this host still answers. See [constant API_VERSION].
