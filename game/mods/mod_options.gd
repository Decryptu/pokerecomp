## What the player chose for each mod's registered settings. The file under
## user:// is the installation's own values and is what a NEW run is created from;
## per-mod save data is a separate thing. A run bound with [method bind_run] takes
## over while it is played, because a draw distance that changed under a loaded
## slot would make that slot's recorded walk unreproducible. Only values are kept:
## what a setting is and what it falls back to is the mod's own registration, so a
## leftover row costs nothing and a changed ladder sees its stored value refused.
