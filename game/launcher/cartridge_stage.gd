class_name Gen2CartridgeStage
extends Control

## The shelf itself: a carousel that wraps, with the selected cartridge always in
## the middle at full size and every other one the same step smaller beside it.
##
## Placement runs off one continuous [member _scroll] rather than off the integer
## selection, so a step animates as a slide and the cartridge that has to cross
## the row does it off the edge instead of through the middle. Children are placed
## by hand because a container would fight the animations for the same
## [member Control.position].
