extends Node

## A non-interactive title-screen loop, picture and music, for the launcher
## backdrop. It hosts only [Gen2TitleScene] and [Gen2TitlePage]; the boot cinema
## that advances into the intro and menu is never created. What it does create is
## the cartridge sound driver, so the screen is heard as well as seen: the same
## `MUSIC_TITLE` the title screen plays, at [constant VOLUME_SCALE] of the
## player's settings, looping for as long as the backdrop is up.
