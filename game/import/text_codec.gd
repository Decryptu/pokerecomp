## The Generation 2 character encoding, for the international ROMs. One byte per
## character terminated by $50, the alphabet in runs: $80 is "A", $A0 is "a", $F6
## is "0". Some codes expand to whole words or name the player at print time;
## those stay bracketed markers so nothing is silently lost. The Japanese
## cartridges reuse most of this range for kana and are not in [RomRegistry]. A
## byte does not name a character on its own: `constants/charmap.asm` maps the
## $60 to $7F run twice and $6e three times, so a byte means whichever strip the
## hardware last loaded, and every entry point takes the strip.

const TERMINATOR: int = 0x50
const SPACE: int = 0x7F
## `'<NEXT>'`, the line break `_ComposeMailMessage` writes into the middle of a
## mail buffer and `PlaceString` drops two rows on.
const NEXT_LINE: int = 0x4E

## `_LoadStandardFont`'s strip, and `_LoadFontsBattleExtra`'s, which
## `engine/events/halloffame.asm` calls before it prints a panel.
const FONT_MAIN: StringName = &"main"
const FONT_BATTLE_EXTRA: StringName = &"battle_extra"

## The run `_LoadFontsBattleExtra` overwrites: `ld hl, vTiles2 tile $60` and
## `lb bc, BANK(FontBattleExtra), 25`. Outside it the main font is still up.
const BATTLE_EXTRA_FIRST_CODE: int = 0x60
const BATTLE_EXTRA_LAST_CODE: int = 0x78

## What that run says. The rest is the HP bar's fill levels and the HUD borders,
## graphics rather than characters, so a code in the run and not here has none:
## falling back would decode $75 as an ellipsis when the tile is part of a bar.
const BATTLE_EXTRA_CHARACTERS: Dictionary = {
	0x6E: "<LV>",
	0x70: "<DO>",
	0x71: "◀",
	0x72: "『",
	0x73: "<ID>",
	0x74: "№",
}

## `'▲'`, which `_LoadFontsExtra2` parks in the middle of that run: a scrolling
## menu draws it and nothing else does, so it is the one code in $60 to $78 that
## is a character under the main font as well.
const UP_ARROW_CODE: int = 0x61

## `charmap.asm`'s "…", the one code in that run source text writes as itself.
## `_LoadFontsExtra1` is what puts a tile under it, which is why the importer
## checks this one glyph by shape (`RomImporter.verify_font_extra`).
const ELLIPSIS_CODE: int = 0x75

## The lowest code with a tile. Below it is a space, border, control code or a
## print-time name, so it is also the line between [method encode]'s range and
## what only [method decode] understands.
const FIRST_PRINTABLE: int = 0x80

## What an unencodable character becomes: "?", because a question mark on screen
## is a bug someone will report and a dropped character is not.
const UNKNOWN: int = 0xE6

## `constants/charmap.asm`'s "#" is $54, which `CheckDict` prints as this word.
## [method encode] writes the word rather than the code, since only the word has
## glyphs; decoding $54 still answers "POKé", so a round trip is unchanged.
const POKE_SHORTHAND: String = "#"
const POKE_WORD: String = "POK\u00e9"

## The same two codes spelled the other way pret spells them, and the tiles each
## one actually draws. `CheckDict` hands $24 to `PlacePOKE`, whose text is
## `db "<PO><KE>@"`, and $4a to `PlacePKMN`, whose text is `db "<PK><MN>@"`: two
## dedicated narrow tiles each, never the four letters `PlacePOKe` prints for
## `#`. Without this each angle bracket encodes as UNKNOWN and prints "?".
const WORD_TILES: Dictionary = {
	"<POKE>": [0x70, 0x71],
	"<PKMN>": [0xE1, 0xE2],
}

## The letters to fall back to when the loaded strip has no such tile: only the
## battle-extra one, where $70 and $71 are `<DO>` and `◀`. Same policy as
## [method _battle_extra_encodings]' dropped run, and no battle text writes
## `<POKE>` anyway; `<PKMN>`'s $e1 and $e2 sit outside that run and are exact.
const WORD_FALLBACKS: Dictionary = {
	"<POKE>": POKE_WORD,
	"<PKMN>": "PKMN",
}

## The longest sequence one tile stands for: the apostrophe ligatures and PK/MN
## are two characters in one glyph. [constant WORD_TILES]' spellings are longer
## and are matched ahead of this run rather than through it. The three word codes
## themselves sit below FIRST_PRINTABLE and are decode-only; write "#" for $54 as
## the source charmap does.
