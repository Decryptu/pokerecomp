extends RefCounted

## Where decoded cartridge data lives between runs.
##
## Under [code]user://[/code], never inside the project: cartridge-derived data
## must not be committed or exported. This is the runtime half of the rule
## .gitignore and the pre-commit hook enforce at build time.
##
## One directory per dump, named by game and hash, so two revisions never share a
## cache and a re-import cannot half-overwrite the last one.
##
## Pixel data is raw colour indices rather than images: it is what the renderer
## wants, with palettes applied per species and shiny state at draw time, and it
## avoids a decode round-trip whose exactness would have to be trusted.
