## Every stable gameplay SITE the cartridge hands something out at, decoded once
## and addressed by an id that does not move: starters, gifts, static battles,
## trades, prizes, ground items, badges and shops. The host owns the decoding and
## the mod owns the placement, so a randomizer needs no private copy of cartridge
## semantics. A patch changes a FIELD of a row and never the script behind it.
##
## Nothing is imported for this: every row is derived from the cache and written
## beside it as a sidecar, so an absent or stale one is rebuilt rather than bumped.
