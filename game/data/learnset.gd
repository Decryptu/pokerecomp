## What a Pokemon knows, worked out from its level-up moves. The cartridge asks
## two different questions and neither answer is the other's shortcut:
## [method moves_at_level] furnishes a newly created Pokemon and stops at the
## first move above the level being filled for; [method moves_learned_at] offers a
## just-levelled one something new and takes entries at exactly the level reached.
## One species' list is not ascending
## ([constant Gen2Layout.UNSORTED_LEARNSET_SPECIES]), so a wild Muk really is short
## three moves a raised Muk has.

## How many moves a Pokémon can know at once.
const MOVE_SLOTS: int = 4


## The moves a Pokémon of [param level] is created knowing, in the order it knows
## them.
##
## Walked from the start, skipping already-known moves, stopping at the first
## entry above [param level] rather than filtering the whole list. A full four
## slots pushes the oldest out, so the answer is the last four learnable moves.

## `FillMoves` itself, which is what [method moves_at_level] is one call of.
## [param known] is filled in place and may already hold moves: a slot is taken
## when one is empty, and the four are shifted down when none is. [param above] is
## `wPrevPartyLevel`, and anything above zero is the `wSkipMovesBeforeLevelUp`
## branch, which offers only the levels between the two. `known` is padded with
## zeroes only if it arrived that way, so a party row's four slots stay four.
