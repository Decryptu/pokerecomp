## Whether a proposed placement can still be finished, answered by the host: a mod
## shuffling badges and key items can write a seed nobody can beat, and the gates
## are the cartridge's. Walks the [Gen2WorldCatalog] as a dependency graph and
## answers with the FIRST requirement that was never satisfiable.
##
## It proves one thing: nothing critical is locked behind itself. Story events
## and a site with no attributed map are both taken as satisfiable, since a
## shuffle that only moves rewards cannot make either unreachable.

## What a validation answers with when it fails: which check could not be
## reached, and the one requirement of it that never became satisfiable.
