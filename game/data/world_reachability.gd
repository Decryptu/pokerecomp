## Which maps a player can stand on with a given set of field moves, derived from
## the cartridge's own collision, warps and connections: the half of a progression
## proof that is not about rewards. Nothing here is written down, the flood asking
## [Gen2WorldCollision] and [Gen2WorldFieldMove] what `DoPlayerMovement` asks.
##
## The unit is the MAP rather than the cell, which is the granularity a placement
## is decided at, and the flood is conservative in one direction only: it can call
## a map reachable that a cell-exact walk would not, never the reverse.

## The moves an edge can ask for, in the order a report lists them.
