## The play timer the trainer card prints (`home/game_time.asm`, `GameTimer`). Not
## the day cycle: [Gen2WorldClock] is real time and answers what hour the world is
## in, while this counts hardware frames of actual play. The cartridge keeps both
## and they disagree the moment the game is closed. `GameTimer` counts 60 frames
## to a second even though a frame is 1/59.7275 s, so the play timer runs about
## half a percent slow against a wall clock: the cartridge's own arithmetic,
## mirrored rather than corrected.

## `GameTimer.Function`'s own comparisons.
