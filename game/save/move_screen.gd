class_name Gen2MoveScreen
extends RefCounted

## The move screen's model (`MoveScreenLoop` in `engine/pokemon/mon_menu.asm`):
## which member of the party is shown, which of its moves the cursor is on, and
## which one is being moved. [Gen2MoveScreenPage] draws the answer.
##
## `ManagePokemonMoves` is opened over the party menu and hands control back on
## the way out, so this owns no nodes, exactly like [Gen2MonStatsScreen]. The two
## moves that trade places trade their PP with them, which is `.place_move`
## copying `wPartyMon1Moves` and `wPartyMon1PP` in the same shape.

## `.exit`, which is B with nothing held.
signal closed
## `PlayClickSFX` on every press this screen answers, and `SFX_SWITCH_POKEMON`
## twice once two moves have traded places.
signal sfx_requested(index: int, waited: bool)
## `ChooseMoveToDelete`'s own answer, when the screen was opened as the move
## deleter's list rather than as `ManagePokemonMoves`: the row A landed on, or
## -1 for the carry `.b_button` sets.
signal selection_made(move_index: int)

## `constants/sfx_constants.asm`.

## `ChooseMoveToDelete`'s own list. `DeleteMoveScreen2DMenuData` accepts
## `PAD_UP | PAD_DOWN | PAD_A | PAD_B` and nothing else, so there is no cycling
## between members and no move to hold: A answers the caller and B is its carry.
